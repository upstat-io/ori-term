# Review Bugs

Review open bugs in `plans/bug-tracker/`, check for OBE (Overtaken By Events), verify fix rigor on resolved bugs, and prioritize what to fix next.

## Usage

```
/review-bugs [target]
```

- No args: review all subsystems
- `01` or `widgets`: review UI Widgets bugs only
- `08` or `core-terminal`: review Core Terminal bugs only
- `all`: review everything
- `critical`: review only critical/high bugs across all subsystems

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Open Bugs

Read `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md` first to discover the current section layout (the Quick Reference table is authoritative — section topics evolve). Then read each `plans/bug-tracker/section-NN-*.md` file that matches the target and collect all `- [ ]` items.

The current sections (as of this writing — verify against `00-overview.md`):

```
plans/bug-tracker/section-01-ui-widgets.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-02-settings-dialog.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-03-ui-framework.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-04-fonts.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-05-config.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-06-rendering-perf.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-07-ci-build.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-08-core-terminal.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-09-session.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-10-platform-windows.md
plans/bug-tracker/section-11-mux.md
```

Also check for any existing fix section files:
```
plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-*.md
```

### Step 2: OBE Check

For each open bug, check if it's been overtaken by events:

1. **Grep for the repro file** — does the test now pass? Use the mandatory 150-second timeout (see `.claude/rules/tests.md` §Running Tests):
   ```bash
   timeout 150 cargo test {test_name} 2>&1 | tail -5
   ```
   Or for a conformance test (teseq / tack / vttest / widget harness / visual-regression):
   ```bash
   timeout 150 cargo test -p {crate} --test {harness} {test_name} 2>&1 | tail -5
   ```

2. **Check if the affected code was rewritten** — has the file/function been significantly changed since the bug was filed?
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --since="{found_date}" -- {subsystem_path} | head -10
   ```

3. **Check if a recent plan fixed it** — grep completed plans for the bug area:
   ```bash
   grep -r "{keyword}" plans/completed/ | head -5
   ```

If the bug is OBE, mark it resolved:
```markdown
- [x] `[BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}]` **{title}** — found by {source}.
  Resolved: OBE on {YYYY-MM-DD}. {What fixed it — commit, plan, or rewrite}.
```

### Step 3: Validate Remaining Bugs

For bugs that aren't OBE, do a quick sanity check:
- Is the severity still accurate? (code changes may have made it worse or better)
- Is the subsystem assignment still correct? (code may have moved)
- Is the repro still valid?

Update entries if needed.

### Step 4: Audit Recently Resolved Bugs for Fix Rigor

For each bug marked `- [x]` since the last review, verify that the fix followed plan-section rigor:

1. **Check for fix section file** — does `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md` exist?
   - If YES: verify the completion checklist is fully checked off (especially TPR and hygiene review)
   - If NO: flag as **rigor gap** — the fix landed without plan-section discipline

2. **Check for test coverage** — does the resolution mention specific tests?
   - Semantic pin test present? (test that only passes with correct semantics)
   - Negative pin test present? (test that rejects old/broken behavior)
   - If resolution says "OBE" this is acceptable — OBE bugs were fixed as a side effect of other work

3. **Check for TPR/hygiene** — was the fix reviewed?
   - Critical/High bugs: TPR + hygiene review is MANDATORY
   - Medium bugs: TPR is expected, hygiene review recommended
   - Low bugs: neither required but documented if done

**Rigor gap handling:**
- Bugs fixed without a fix section BEFORE this workflow was established: note as legacy, no action needed
- Bugs fixed without a fix section AFTER this workflow: flag to user — the fix may be incomplete.
  Ask: "BUG-XX-NNN was resolved without a fix section. Should we retroactively verify the fix quality, or accept it as-is?"

### Step 5: Present Summary

```
## Bug Tracker Review — {date}

### Summary
- Total open: {N}
- Checked for OBE: {N}
- Resolved (OBE): {N}
- Still open: {N}
- Fix sections in progress: {N} (list IDs)

### By Severity
- Critical: {N} {list titles}
- High: {N} {list titles}
- Medium: {N}
- Low: {N}

### By Subsystem
| Subsystem | Open | Critical | High | In-Progress Fixes |
|-----------|------|----------|------|-------------------|
| Parser & Lexer | {N} | {N} | {N} | {N} |
| ... | | | | |

### OBE Resolutions
{List of bugs resolved as OBE with brief explanation}

### Fix Rigor Audit
- Bugs with fix sections (complete): {N}
- Bugs with fix sections (in-progress): {N}
- Bugs resolved without fix sections: {N} (legacy: {N}, gap: {N})
- TPR coverage on critical/high fixes: {N}/{total}

### Recommended Actions
{Prioritized list of bugs worth fixing now, considering:
 - Critical bugs block work
 - High bugs in areas with active roadmap sections
 - Clusters of bugs in the same file/function (fix together via single fix section)
 - In-progress fix sections that should be completed
}

### Intelligence Cross-Reference (CONDITIONAL)
{If the intelligence graph is available, cross-reference high-priority bugs
 against reference compiler issues — see Step 5.5 below for details}
```

### Step 5.5: CONDITIONAL — Intelligence Cross-Reference

If the intelligence graph is available, cross-reference recommended bugs against reference compiler issues to enrich recommendations with fix-approach confidence.

Follow the canonical intel-summary injection protocol for availability check + base queries:

@.claude/skills/dual-tpr/compose-intel-summary.md

**Bug-specific extension** (per SSOT Step F — /review-bugs domain extension):

1. For each high-priority bug being recommended for fixing, run:
   - `intel-query.sh --human search "<bug title keywords>" --limit 5`
   - `intel-query.sh --human fixed "<bug category>" --repo rust,swift,koka,lean4 --limit 5`
   - `intel-query.sh --human callers "<repro symbol>" --repo ori` — blast radius
   - `intel-query.sh --human file-symbols "<subsystem path>" --repo ori` — cluster related bugs by module
   - `intel-query.sh --human similar "<buggy function>" --repo rust,swift,koka,lean4 --limit 5` — find reference fixes

2. Use verified results (SSOT Step D verify-before-citing applies) to enrich the `### Recommended Actions` section:
   - Bugs where 2+ reference compilers hit the same failure mode → higher confidence the fix approach is known (mention in recommendation)
   - Bugs matching "fixed" issues in reference compilers → note the fix approach for the implementer's benefit
   - Bug clusters (multiple Ori bugs matching the same reference compiler issue class) → recommend fixing together via a single fix section

3. **Opportunistic preset mapping** — If the bug's subsystem maps to an intelligence preset per `.claude/rules/intelligence.md` §Subsystem Mapping (e.g., `ori_arc` bugs → `ori-arc` preset), use the preset query in addition to `search`/`fixed` for more targeted results.

If unavailable or empty, present recommendations without intelligence enrichment — the prioritization logic works without it.

### Step 6: Ask What to Do

Use AskUserQuestion with options:
1. **Fix a specific bug** — pick one to work on now (will invoke `/fix-bug`)
2. **Fix all critical bugs** — work through critical bugs in priority order using `/fix-bug` for each
3. **Resume an in-progress fix** — continue a fix section that was started but not completed
4. **Done reviewing** — no action needed right now

### Step 7: Dispatch to /fix-bug

When the user selects a bug to fix, invoke `/fix-bug BUG-XX-NNN` to begin the fix with full plan-section rigor. Do NOT start fixing the bug ad-hoc — the `/fix-bug` workflow ensures:
- A fix section file is created BEFORE any code changes
- TDD matrix tests are written and verified failing BEFORE the fix
- The completion checklist is followed (including TPR + hygiene review)
- The fix section provides a permanent record of investigation and verification

**MANDATORY:** Every bug selected for fixing goes through `/fix-bug`. No exceptions, no "this one is simple enough to fix inline." The rigor is the process.
