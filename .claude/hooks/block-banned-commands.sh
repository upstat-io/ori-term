# ── Guard timeouts on review (codex/gemini) commands ────────────────
# codex/gemini exec calls are review tasks, NOT tests. They take 20-45
# minutes in practice — reviews barely ever finish in under 10 minutes,
# and the operational sweet spot is 20-45 min. Gemini is substantially
# slower than codex (cold-starts of 8-10 min are routine), so the ceiling
# must accommodate gemini's worst case. Block any timeout outside that
# window so a foreground review can't be killed mid-stream.
# Minimum allowed: 1200000 ms (20 minutes).
# Maximum allowed: 2700000 ms (45 minutes).
#
# BUG-08-001: The matcher must fire only on GENUINE top-level codex or
# gemini invocations — never on commands that merely mention the literal
# strings in a path, argument, message body, or quoted text.
#
# TPR-04-001-codex/gemini fix (commit pending): the previous regex-based
# REVIEW_CMD_RE approach leaked bypasses because shell is not a regular
# language. Seven distinct bypass forms were verified against the old
# regex (escaped double quotes, $(...) command substitution, backtick
# substitution, heredocs inside $(...), backslash-newline continuation,
# literal newline separators, env-var values with internal whitespace
# that the regex fragmented). Each new alternation opened up more edge
# cases.
#
# The correct architectural fix is shell-aware tokenization. We delegate
# classification to `.claude/hooks/classify-review-command.py`, which
# walks the command string with a character-level state machine tracking
# quote state, subshell depth, command substitution, and compound
# operators. The classifier returns exit 0 iff the command contains a
# top-level codex/gemini invocation at any command position.
#
# See `.claude/hooks/verify-hook.sh` for the full matrix and
# `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-08-001.md` for the original design rationale.
