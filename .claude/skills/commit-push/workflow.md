# /commit-push — Full Workflow

This is the protocol the sub-agent dispatched by `SKILL.md` executes. The SKILL.md parent should NOT execute these steps inline — it dispatches an isolated Sonnet Agent that reads this file end-to-end and runs it.

Stage, commit, and push all changes to the remote repository using conventional commit format.

## Usage (slash-level, for reference)

```
/commit-push           # Commit and push immediately (no confirmation)
/commit-push preview   # Show summary and ask for confirmation before committing
```

Arguments flow into this workflow as `<ARGS>` (substituted by SKILL.md at dispatch time).

## Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** Execute each step in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Check Git Status

Run these commands to see what will be committed:

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

### Step 2: Analyze and Draft Commit Message

Review the changes and create a commit message following conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>
```

**Valid types:**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Code style changes (formatting, etc) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests |
| `build` | Changes to build system or dependencies |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

**Scope** is optional. Use the primary module affected (e.g., `typeck`, `parser`, `llvm`).

### Step 3: Preview Mode (only if `preview` argument is passed)

**If the args contain `preview`:**
1. Show the user a summary of files changed and the proposed commit message.
2. Ask: "Shall I proceed with this commit?"
3. **Do NOT commit until user confirms.**

**Otherwise (default):** Skip directly to Step 4 — no confirmation needed.

### Step 4: Pre-Format (fixes the restaging issue)

**Run `cargo fmt --all` BEFORE staging.** This formats every file in the tree so the formatter's output is captured in the snapshot you're about to stage — NOT produced as a side-effect after staging.

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```

**Why this ordering matters:** Lefthook's pre-commit `fmt` step also runs `fmt-all.sh` with `stage_fixed: true`, but `stage_fixed` only restages files that were *already* in the index at the moment the hook fired. Any files the formatter touches that weren't intentionally staged get left as unstaged dirt in the working tree *post-commit* — the "restaging issue." Running `fmt-all.sh` here, before `git add`, means:

1. All formatter changes (on our target files AND any incidental fixes elsewhere) land in the working tree first.
2. `git add -A` then stages a fully-formatted snapshot.
3. Lefthook's `fmt` step becomes a no-op (idempotent — nothing left to fix).
4. The commit lands with a clean working tree — no post-commit dirt to chase.

`fmt-all.sh` is fast on an already-formatted tree (`cargo fmt --check` short-circuits) and harmless when there's nothing to fix, so running it unconditionally is cheap insurance.

### Step 5: Stage and Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<commit message here>
EOF
)"
```

### !! HOOK FAILURE PROTOCOL — READ THIS IF STEP 5 FAILS !!

If `git commit` fails because a pre-commit hook rejected it (clippy errors, test failures, formatting failures, version-sync issues — anything):

**STOP. Do not take any further action yet.**

A hook failure is a context-collapse event. The moment a commit is blocked, the brain wants to unblock it — and that pressure causes goal displacement: the goal shifts from "have correct code" to "make the commit succeed." These are not the same goal. Before you do anything else, you must re-ground yourself.

---

#### Step 0: Re-Ground (MANDATORY before any other action)

Do these in order before touching a single file:

1. **Re-read your active task.** Ask: what was I actually working on?
   - If you were fixing a bug: re-read the fix section file (`plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md`). What is the stated deliverable? What invariant am I enforcing?
   - If you were executing a plan section: re-read the section file. What checkbox was I completing? What is its stated goal?
   - If you were doing standalone work: re-state in one sentence what you were trying to accomplish.

2. **Re-read The One Rule** from CLAUDE.md §"The One Rule: Correctness Above All":
   > Every decision you make must optimize for correctness. The most correct, clean, and proper fix is the ONLY acceptable fix. Effort, time, cost, scope, risk are ALL irrelevant. Correctness wins. Always.

3. **Re-read the hook failure output.** Now that you are re-grounded: what did the hook actually catch? Read the error message fresh, with your real goals in mind — not through the lens of "how do I unblock the commit?"

4. **Now decide.** From this re-grounded position, the correct action is almost always obvious: the hook found something broken, and the job is to fix it correctly. The commit will follow when the code is correct.

---

#### Banned responses to a hook failure (all equivalent to bypass)

- Adding `#[allow(clippy::...)]` to suppress a clippy error
- Weakening a test (removing assertions, changing `assert_eq!` to `assert!`, commenting out cases)
- Adding a gate/flag/early-return that makes the failing code path unreachable
- Commenting out or `#[ignore]`-ing a failing test
- Narrowing test coverage to avoid the failing case
- Any change whose stated or unstated purpose is "make the hook pass" rather than "fix the broken thing"

If you find yourself considering any of these: you have not re-grounded. Go back to Step 0.

---

#### The correct response after re-grounding

1. Fix the underlying problem correctly — per The One Rule.
2. Run `cargo test --all` (Bash tool `timeout: 150000`) to verify the real fix works end-to-end.
3. Then retry `/commit-push`.

If the fix is large (touches multiple crates, requires architectural change), that is not a reason to reach for a workaround. The size of the correct fix is irrelevant. If genuinely blocked (missing domain knowledge, need user decision), use `AskUserQuestion` — do NOT silently reach for a shortcut.

---

### Step 6: Post-Commit Dirty-Tree Check

After the commit lands, verify the working tree is clean:

```bash
git status --short
```

**If the output is empty**, proceed to push.

**If the output is non-empty**, the pre-commit hook's later steps (`full-check`, `version-sync`) or some other process modified files after staging. STOP and report:

- What's dirty (`git status --short`)
- Possible causes: (1) a hook step modified files unexpectedly, (2) an untracked file was never staged, (3) a file changed between `git add -A` and `git commit`
- Ask the user how to resolve: follow-up commit, stash, or discard. Do NOT auto-amend (per CLAUDE.md: always create NEW commits rather than amending).

Only proceed to Step 7 if the tree is clean.

### Step 7: Push

```bash
git push
```

Report success or any errors.

## Checklist

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] `git status` was checked (Step 1)
- [ ] Commit message follows conventional format (Step 2)
- [ ] If preview mode: user confirmed before committing (Step 3)
- [ ] `cargo fmt --all` ran BEFORE staging (Step 4 — prevents post-commit dirt)
- [ ] Main changes staged + committed (Step 5)
- [ ] Post-commit dirty-tree check passed (Step 6)
- [ ] Changes pushed (Step 7)

---

## Example Commit Message

```
perf(typeck): optimize line lookup and hash map usage

- Add LineOffsetTable for O(log n) line lookups instead of O(n)
- Switch to FxHashMap/FxHashSet in type checker components
- Add index for O(1) associated type lookups
- Optimize diagnostic queue sorting
```

---

## Rules

- Always run `git status` before committing.
- Default mode: commit and push without confirmation (user trusts the process).
- Preview mode (`/commit-push preview`): show summary and wait for confirmation.
- Never force push or use destructive git operations.
- Keep the first line of commit message under 72 characters.
- Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages.
- **NEVER discard uncommitted work**: Do NOT use `git checkout -- <file>`, `git restore <file>`, `git reset --hard`, or `git clean` to "clean up" unrelated changes. The user runs parallel sessions — uncommitted files may be active work. Stage only your files with `git add <specific files>` instead of `git add -A` when other files are dirty. Dirty commits with extra files are acceptable; lost work is not.
- **When pre-commit hooks fail on files you didn't touch**: Stage only your specific files, not `-A`. If hooks still fail on unstaged files, report to the user — never discard.

---

## Return to parent

When the push succeeds (or preview is declined, or an error prevents push), return a concise final report:

- Commit SHA (short) and subject line
- Remote branch pushed to
- Any warnings surfaced by hooks
- If stopped short (dirty-tree check failed, preview declined, hook failure): what's pending and why

The parent has no context from this run — your summary is the only record it sees.
