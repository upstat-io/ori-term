# Fix Next Bug

Automatically pick the highest priority open bug from the bug tracker and fix it using `/fix-bug`. After each fix completes, prompt the user to continue with the next highest priority bug or stop.

## Usage

```
/fix-next-bug
```

No arguments needed — the skill auto-selects based on priority.

## Priority Ordering

Bugs are selected in this order:
1. **Severity** — `critical` > `high` > `medium` > `low`
2. **Section number** — lower section number first (use the section ordering in `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`)
3. **Ordinal** — lower bug number first within the same section and severity

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan All Open Bugs

Read every section file under `plans/bug-tracker/` to collect every `- [ ]` entry:

```
plans/bug-tracker/section-*.md
```

For each open bug, extract:
- **ID**: `BUG-{section}-{ordinal}`
- **Severity**: critical, high, medium, or low
- **Title**: the bold text after severity
- **Repro**: repro line if present
- **Subsystem**: subsystem line if present

### Step 2: Sort by Priority

Sort all open bugs using the priority ordering above:
1. Group by severity (critical first)
2. Within each severity group, sort by section number ascending
3. Within each section, sort by ordinal ascending

### Step 3: Check for Empty Queue

If there are no open bugs:
```
No open bugs in the tracker. All clear!
```
Stop — nothing to do.

### Step 4: Present the Selected Bug

Show the user what's been selected and the queue behind it:

```
## Fix Next Bug — Queue

Selected: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
  Repro: {repro}
  Subsystem: {subsystem}

Remaining queue ({N-1} bugs):
  1. [BUG-...][severity] title
  2. [BUG-...][severity] title
  ...
```

### Step 5: Choose Mode

Before fixing the first bug, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

```
Ready to start with: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}

How would you like to proceed?

1. **One at a time** — Fix this bug, then ask before each next bug
2. **Fix all bugs non-stop** — Loop through ALL open bugs automatically with zero interaction. No questions, no pauses, no stops. Runs /fix-bug for every bug in priority order until the queue is empty or you manually stop me.
```

- If **One at a time**: proceed to Step 6 (interactive mode)
- If **Fix all**: proceed to Step 7 (autopilot mode)

### Step 5.5: Commit Verification Gate — After EVERY Fix

**After `/fix-bug` completes (in EITHER mode), before doing anything else:**

1. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes (staged, unstaged, or untracked files in oriterm/oriterm_*/plans paths)
2. If there are uncommitted changes:
   - Invoke `/commit-push` to commit all changes
   - Verify the commit succeeded (clean `git status`)
3. If `git status` is clean, proceed

**This gate is non-negotiable.** A fix that isn't committed doesn't exist. Never proceed to the next bug with uncommitted work — it will contaminate the next fix's diff, TPR review, and git history.

### Step 6: Interactive Mode — Fix and Prompt

Invoke `/fix-bug BUG-{section}-{ordinal}` (without `--autopilot`) to fix the selected bug with full plan-section rigor.

**Let `/fix-bug` run its complete workflow** — investigation, fix section creation, TDD matrix, implementation, completion checklist (including TPR and hygiene review). Do NOT shortcut any phase.

**Run the Commit Verification Gate (Step 5.5)** after `/fix-bug` returns.

After commit verification passes, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

```
Fix complete for [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}].

Next bug in queue: [BUG-{next}][{severity}] {title}
{N-2} more bugs remaining after that.

Continue with the next bug?
```

Options:
- **Yes** — go back to Step 1 (re-scan, in case OBE or new bugs were filed during the fix)
- **No** — stop here
- **Skip** — skip this next bug and move to the one after it

Loop behavior:
- If **Yes**: re-scan the bug tracker (Step 1) to get a fresh view — bugs may have been resolved as OBE during the previous fix, or new bugs may have been filed. Pick the new highest priority and continue.
- If **Skip**: re-scan and exclude the skipped bug ID from selection for this session only. Pick the next one.
- If **No**: report a summary of what was done and stop.

### Step 7: Autopilot Mode — Fix All Non-Stop

**This mode runs until the bug queue is empty or the user manually interrupts. NOTHING ELSE STOPS IT.**

**Before entering the loop**, create a persistent reminder task using `TaskCreate`:
```
Subject: "AUTOPILOT: Do NOT stop until bug queue is empty"
Description: "After EVERY /fix-bug outcome (fixed, escalated, blocked, OBE): commit gate → re-scan → pick next bug. The session summary is ONLY printed when re-scan returns zero open bugs. There is NO 'natural stopping point.' The count of bugs processed is irrelevant — only the queue state matters. If you are about to write a session summary, STOP and check: is the queue empty? If no, pick the next bug."
```
This task must remain `in_progress` for the entire autopilot session. Only mark it `completed` when you print the final report (queue empty or user stopped). This ensures the reminder stays visible even if earlier conversation context is compressed.

**CRITICAL: This is the ONLY task for the entire autopilot session.** Do NOT use `TaskCreate` for any other purpose during autopilot — not for tracking `/fix-bug` phases, not for sub-steps, not for anything. Additional tasks would become the "current work" and their completion would signal the loop is done, causing premature termination.

Loop:
1. Invoke `/fix-bug --autopilot BUG-{section}-{ordinal}` — the `--autopilot` flag tells `/fix-bug` to operate with zero user interaction, no pausing, no `AskUserQuestion`, full rigor, no hacks. It must complete the fix no matter the scope.
2. **Run the Commit Verification Gate (Step 5.5)** — check `git status`, commit via `/commit-push` if anything is uncommitted. Do NOT proceed until clean.
3. When commit is verified, **immediately** re-scan the bug tracker (Step 1) — do NOT output a summary, do NOT pause, do NOT reflect on what was done
4. If open bugs remain, pick the next highest priority bug and invoke `/fix-bug --autopilot` again
5. If no open bugs remain, **ONLY THEN** stop and print the final report

**No questions. No pauses. No user interaction. No mid-loop summaries.** Just pick → fix → pick → fix until done.

**The `--autopilot` flag is critical** — it tells `/fix-bug` that:
- It CANNOT pause and ask questions — it must make decisions autonomously based on CLAUDE.md rules and reference repos
- It MUST re-read CLAUDE.md at the start (Phase -1) to ground itself in the rules
- It MUST follow the Broken Window Policy and the "NO WORKAROUNDS. NO HACKS. NO SHORTCUTS." rule — no shortcuts regardless of scope
- It MUST continue until the bug is fully fixed, reviewed (TPR + hygiene), and committed
- It MUST return control to `/fix-next-bug` after each outcome (fixed, escalated, blocked, OBE) — never just stop

**The ONLY things that stop autopilot mode:**
- The bug queue is empty (all open bugs processed)
- The user manually interrupts/stops the session

**BANNED in autopilot mode — these are NOT valid reasons to stop:**
- "Session summary" or "progress report" mid-loop — the summary is ONLY printed when the queue is empty
- "Natural stopping point" — there is no such thing; the loop continues until the queue is empty
- "Already processed N bugs" — the count is irrelevant; the queue state is all that matters
- "Bug was complex/couldn't fix" — escalate to `/create-plan` or mark blocked, then CONTINUE to the next bug
- "Bug was latent/OBE" — mark it, then CONTINUE to the next bug
- Generating output that looks like a wrap-up — a session summary IS an exit; do NOT write one until the queue is empty

**Valid `/fix-bug` outcomes in autopilot — ALL require continuing to the next bug:**
- **Fixed** — bug resolved, tests pass, TPR clean → continue
- **Escalated** — too large, `/create-plan` run → continue
- **Blocked** — prerequisite missing, bug entry updated → continue
- **OBE** — already fixed, marked resolved → continue

After EVERY outcome, the next action is ALWAYS: commit gate → re-scan → pick next bug. No exceptions.

### Handling Plan Escalation

When `/fix-bug` escalates a bug to `/create-plan` (Phase 1.5 scope assessment), this is a valid outcome — not a failure. The bug was too large for an inline fix, and a plan was created as the deliverable.

In the loop:
- **Interactive mode**: report the escalation, then ask to continue to the next bug as normal
- **Autopilot mode**: note the escalation, run the Commit Verification Gate (the plan files need committing), then immediately continue to the next bug

Do NOT re-select an escalated bug — it is no longer an open bug fix candidate (it has a plan reference in its entry).

### Final Report

**This is ONLY generated when the queue is empty (all bugs processed) or the user manually stops.** NEVER generate this mid-loop as a "checkpoint" or "progress report."

```
## Fix Next Bug — Session Summary

Mode: {interactive | autopilot}
Bugs processed this session: {total}

Fixed: {N}
{For each:}
  - [BUG-XX-NNN][severity] title — fixed

Escalated to plans: {N}
{For each:}
  - [BUG-XX-NNN][severity] title — escalated to plans/{plan-name}/

Blocked (prerequisite missing): {N}
{For each:}
  - [BUG-XX-NNN][severity] title — blocked: {reason}

Resolved as OBE: {N}
{For each:}
  - [BUG-XX-NNN][severity] title — already fixed

{If any skipped (interactive mode only):}
Skipped: {N}
  - [BUG-XX-NNN][severity] title — skipped

Remaining open bugs: {N}
```

## Key Rules

- **Always re-scan** before picking the next bug — the queue is dynamic
- **Full `/fix-bug` rigor** — every bug goes through the complete workflow, no shortcuts
- **Never skip phases** — investigation, TDD, implementation, TPR, hygiene — all mandatory per `/fix-bug`
- **Mode is chosen once** — the mode question is asked only at the start, not after each bug
- **Autopilot = zero interaction, zero stopping** — no questions, no confirmations, no pauses, no mid-loop summaries between bugs. The user chose this mode knowing what it means. The loop runs until the queue is EMPTY.
- **Every `/fix-bug` outcome continues the loop** — fixed, escalated, blocked, OBE — ALL of these are valid outcomes that lead to picking the next bug. None of them are reasons to stop.
- **The session summary IS the exit** — generating it means the loop is over. NEVER generate it unless the queue is empty or the user stopped you. If you find yourself writing a summary, ask: "is the queue empty?" If no, you are stopping prematurely.
- **Flaky tests ARE bugs** — if a test passes sometimes and fails sometimes, that is a bug. Do NOT retry and move on. Research the root cause (race condition, timing, temp files, state leakage, non-deterministic ordering, GPU device-loss races, surface reconfiguration timing) and fix it so the test is deterministic. File via `/add-bug` if discovered during another fix; fix immediately if it blocks the current work.
- **NEVER investigate "pre-existing?"** — do NOT use `git checkout`, `git stash`, `git bisect`, `git log`, or any other git archaeology to determine whether a bug or test failure existed before your changes. It does not matter. The question "was this pre-existing?" is banned. If it's broken now, fix it now. Spending time checking out old commits to see if something "was already broken" is wasted time that produces zero value. The only question is: is it fixed?
