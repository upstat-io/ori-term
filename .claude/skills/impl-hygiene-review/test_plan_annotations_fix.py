Regression tests for plan-annotations.py --fix mode.

These cover the conservative-removal helper `remove_annotations_from_line`
plus the safety predicate `is_safe_id_context`. They are the permanent
regression guard for the comment-stripping logic — every new pattern or
edge case observed in the wild must land here as a test case BEFORE the
pattern is added to the script.

Run: `python3 .claude/skills/impl-hygiene-review/test_plan_annotations_fix.py`

Exit code 0 = all pass, 1 = at least one failure.
