# Implementation Hygiene Review

Deep, wide-angle review of implementation hygiene against `.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md`. Multi-pass, multi-lens analysis that traces data flow end-to-end, detects algorithmic duplication, and cross-checks findings via third-party review.

**Implementation hygiene is NOT architecture** (design decisions are made). It covers the full plumbing layer — phase boundaries, data flow, error propagation, abstraction discipline, algorithmic DRY, file organization, naming, comments, visibility, and lint discipline.

## Target

`$ARGUMENTS` specifies the boundary or scope to review. **If empty or blank, default to Auto Mode** — the skill autoscopes to the current active work arc (uncommitted changes plus recent commits, expanded to full crates per the dependency map). This is the recommended default; explicit modes below are for special cases.

### Auto Mode (default — no arguments) ★ recommended

When called with no arguments, the review autoscopes to the current "session of work" by combining uncommitted changes and recent commits. This is the recommended default for **every** plan section, fix-bug section, and roadmap completion checklist — multi-commit work arcs (feature implementations, bug-fix sequences, plan section work) typically span several commits, and a single-commit view is too narrow to catch the cross-commit drift this review is designed to catch.

**Auto-scoping procedure:**
1. List uncommitted changes: `git diff --name-only HEAD` and `git diff --name-only --cached`
2. Determine the active commit range:
   - If on a non-default branch: `git log --name-only --pretty=format: $(git merge-base HEAD origin/master)..HEAD` (everything since branch divergence from master)
   - If on `master`/`main`: fall back to the last 5 commits (`git log --name-only --pretty=format: HEAD~5..HEAD`)
3. Union the uncommitted file list and the commit-range file list, deduplicate
4. Expand to full crate(s) per the **Dependency map for expansion** below (in the Commit scoping procedure subsection) — if even one `.rs` file in a crate is touched, the whole crate is in scope
5. Apply the standard dependency expansion (touched crate's downstream consumers also enter scope)
6. Proceed with the standard review process using the expanded scope

> **Why no `/impl-hygiene-review last commit`**: a single-commit view is intentionally not supported as a scope. Real work spans multiple commits — a bug fix is often `tests + impl + plan update`, a feature is often `infra + integration + tests`, a refactor often touches several files across several commits. Reviewing only the last commit misses the cross-commit drift the review exists to catch. Use Auto Mode (no arguments) for the normal case, or `last N commits` for explicit narrow scoping when you genuinely want N=2 or N=3.

### Path Mode (explicit crate/directory targets)
- `/impl-hygiene-review oriterm_core oriterm_ui` — review terminal-emulation → UI-framework boundary
- `/impl-hygiene-review oriterm_core/src/grid oriterm_core/src/term_handler.rs` — review grid/VTE internal boundaries
- `/impl-hygiene-review oriterm_ui/src/widgets oriterm_ui/src/pipeline` — review widget → propagation pipeline boundary
- `/impl-hygiene-review oriterm_mux/src/pane/io_thread` — review the pane IO thread's snapshot / reflow discipline
- `/impl-hygiene-review oriterm/src/gpu` — review GPU render path (cached path, compositor, atlas)

### Commit Mode (use a commit range as a scope selector)
- `/impl-hygiene-review last 3 commits` — review files touched by the last N commits (use when N is small and well-defined; for the active work arc, prefer Auto Mode)
- `/impl-hygiene-review <commit-hash>` — review files touched by a specific commit
- `/impl-hygiene-review <commit-A>..<commit-B>` — review the commit range

### Full Project Mode (landscape survey)
- `/impl-hygiene-review full` — review the entire workspace across all crates and boundaries
- `/impl-hygiene-review full --focus=dry` — full review with emphasis on algorithmic duplication
- `/impl-hygiene-review full --focus=leaks` — full review with emphasis on side logic and SSOT

Full project mode is the widest sweep. It reviews every workspace crate (`oriterm_core`, `oriterm_ui`, `oriterm_mux`, `oriterm_ipc`, `oriterm`, plus `crates/oriterm_test_support`), every crate-ownership boundary, all cross-crate interactions, and the full render-path / input-path / pane-lifecycle flows. Use this when you want the complete landscape picture.

**CRITICAL: Commits are scope selectors, NOT content filters.** The commit determines WHICH files and areas to review. Once the files are identified, review them completely — report ALL hygiene findings in those files, regardless of whether the finding is "related to" or "caused by" the commit. The commit is a lens to focus on a region of the codebase, nothing more. Do NOT annotate findings with whether they relate to the commit. Do NOT deprioritize or exclude findings because they predate the commit.

**Commit scoping procedure:**
1. Use `git diff --name-only HEAD~N..HEAD` (or appropriate range) to get the list of changed `.rs` files
2. Expand to include the full crate(s) those files belong to (e.g., if `oriterm_core/src/grid/mod.rs` was touched, include all of `oriterm_core/src/grid/`)
3. **Dependency expansion**: Also include crates that *consume* the changed crate's public types or functions. The dependency direction is locked by `.claude/rules/crate-boundaries.md` — if `oriterm_core` changed, also expand to `oriterm_ui`, `oriterm_mux`, and `oriterm` (its consumers). This catches boundary violations that the changed crate creates for its downstream consumers.
4. Proceed with the standard review process using those crates as the target

**Dependency map for expansion** (canonical; same shape as `.claude/rules/crate-boundaries.md` §Allowed Dependency Direction):
```
oriterm_ipc              → consumed by: oriterm_mux, oriterm
oriterm_core             → consumed by: oriterm_ui, oriterm_mux, oriterm
oriterm_ui               → consumed by: oriterm
oriterm_mux              → consumed by: oriterm
crates/oriterm_test_support → consumed by: any crate's tests (dev-dep)
crates/vte               → consumed by: oriterm_core (vendored patch)
crates/portable-pty      → consumed by: oriterm_mux (vendored patch)
crates/wgpu-hal          → consumed by: oriterm (vendored patch)
```

## Execution

### Phase 0: Automated Static Analysis (Run Tools First)

Before AI review begins, run the automated hygiene tools to handle all deterministic, pattern-based checks. This eliminates 60-70% of surface-level findings from AI context, freeing it for LEAK/SSOT/algorithmic DRY analysis.

**All tools are in this skill's folder** (`.claude/skills/impl-hygiene-review/`).

#### 0a. Run hygiene-lint.py (surface checks — ~2s)

```bash
# Full scan of review scope:
hygiene-lint.py --scope <review-paths> --summary

# Detailed findings:
hygiene-lint.py --scope <review-paths>

# Auto-fix banners and commented-out code:
hygiene-lint.py --scope <review-paths> --fix --apply
```

Covers 15 project-specific checks (clippy handles the rest): file-length, fn-length, nesting-depth, test-ephemeral, test-weak, banners, commented-code, bare-todo, catch-all-arms, string-identity, lib-bodies, deny-unsafe, ignore-tracking, phase-bleeding, swallowed-error.

#### 0b. Run enum-drift.py (cross-crate enum coverage — ~0.5s)

```bash
# All known IR enums:
enum-drift.py --summary

# Specific enum:
enum-drift.py --enum CanExpr TypeTag
```

Detects match arms missing for enum variants across crate boundaries — the most dangerous drift pattern (Rust's exhaustive match only catches within a single crate).

#### 0c. Run plan-annotations.py (stale plan refs — ~1s)

```bash
plan-annotations.sh --scope <review-paths> --cleanup-only
```

Already integrated — classifies plan annotations as stale/active/orphan.

#### 0d. Review tool output, apply auto-fixes

1. Apply auto-fixes: `hygiene-fix.py --scope <review-paths> --apply`
2. Review remaining findings — these feed into Phase 3 Pass 4 (skip manual checks already covered by tools)
3. Tool-reported findings that need AI judgment (e.g., test-weak false positives, string-identity in legitimate contexts) get verified during Pass 4

**After Phase 0**: Passes 1-3 of Phase 3 (LEAK/DRY/Boundary) proceed unchanged — these require AI judgment. Pass 4 (Surface Hygiene) is substantially shorter because the tools already caught the mechanical violations.

### Phase 1: Load Rules & Context

#### 1a. Load Rules

The full rule set is embedded below (source of truth files — do not maintain separate copies):

**Hygiene Rules** (`.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md`):
@.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md

**Code Hygiene** (`.claude/rules/code-hygiene.md`):
@.claude/rules/code-hygiene.md

**Crate Boundaries** (`.claude/rules/crate-boundaries.md`):
@.claude/rules/crate-boundaries.md

**Test Organization** (`.claude/rules/test-organization.md`):
@.claude/rules/test-organization.md

#### 1b. Load Plan Context

Gather context from active and recently-modified plan files so the review doesn't flag work that is already planned, in-progress, or intentionally deferred.

**Procedure:**
1. Run `git diff --name-only HEAD` and `git diff --name-only --cached` to find uncommitted modified files in `plans/`
2. Run `git diff --name-only HEAD~3..HEAD -- plans/` to find plan files changed in recent commits
3. Combine both lists (deduplicate) to get all recently-touched plan files
4. Read each discovered plan file (skip files > 1000 lines — read the `00-overview.md` or `index.md` instead)

**How to use plan context:**

Plan context does NOT suppress or deprioritize findings. Instead, it **annotates** them:

- If a finding falls within scope of an active plan, append `→ covered by plans/{plan}/` to the finding
- If a plan has an active reroute or suspension notice (e.g., "all work suspended until X"), note this in the review preamble so the user knows which areas are in flux
- If a plan explicitly describes a refactor that would resolve a finding, mark it as `[PLANNED]` instead of proposing a separate fix — but still list it so nothing falls through cracks
- Findings NOT covered by any plan are reported normally — these are the high-value discoveries

**Example annotation:**
```
3. **[DRIFT]** `crates/$1/src/check/registration/mod.rs:142` — Missing sync for new `Serialize` variant
   → covered by plans/trait_arch/ (Section 3: Registration Overhaul)
```

This ensures the review adds value by distinguishing "known debt being addressed" from "unknown debt needing attention."

### Phase 2: Map the Full Landscape

Before diving into findings, build a high-level map of the review scope. This is the "go wide" phase — understand the shape before probing the details.

#### 2a. Identify Review Targets

Determine the distinct crates or phase boundaries to review based on the target scope:

1. List the crates (directories) in scope
2. Identify which phase boundaries exist between them (e.g., lexer→parser, parser→types)
3. Map the dependency graph between in-scope crates
4. Group crates into **review units** — each review unit is either:
   - A single crate (for internal review)
   - A pair of crates sharing a boundary (for boundary review)
   - Closely related crates that should be reviewed together

#### 2b. Map Cross-Crate Data Flow (Full Project & Multi-Crate Mode)

For full project mode or when 3+ crates are in scope, spawn an agent to trace the key data flows end-to-end through the pipeline:

1. **Cell flow**: How does a byte from the PTY become a rendered glyph? PTY read (`oriterm_mux`) → VTE parse (`oriterm_core::term_handler`) → grid mutation (`oriterm_core::grid`) → snapshot (`SnapshotDoubleBuffer`) → renderable content (`oriterm_core::renderable_content_into`) → GPU instance writer (`oriterm`/`src/gpu`) → wgpu submit.
2. **Input flow**: How does a key/mouse event route from winit → WindowRoot → propagation pipeline → widget → action dispatch → back to winit? Where are `hot`/`active`/`focused` state owned?
3. **Damage flow**: How do damage rects propagate from grid mutation → snapshot → renderer → GPU copy? Where is "nothing changed this frame" decided?
4. **Lifecycle flow**: Pane create → IO thread spawn → PTY open → first paint → resize → close. Who owns each step?

This agent produces a **flow map** — a brief summary of how each major data category crosses the phase boundaries. This map is passed to all subsequent review agents as context.

#### Intelligence-assisted map (before agent dispatch)

Follow the canonical intel-summary injection protocol:

@.claude/skills/dual-tpr/compose-intel-summary.md

Per SSOT Step F — /impl-hygiene-review flow map: use `file-symbols "<crate/path>" --repo ori` per in-scope crate, `callers`/`callees` per major dispatch or boundary symbol, `similar "<symbol>" --repo rust,swift,lean4 --limit 5` for cross-backend / prior-art checks. Use this map as input to Pass 1 and Pass 2 so the review starts from actual call-graph structure.

### Phase 3: Deep Analysis (Multi-Pass, Multi-Lens)

This is the "go deep" phase. Each review unit gets **multiple analysis passes**, each with a different lens. This catches issues that a single-pass review misses because different violation types require different reading strategies.

For **each review unit** identified in Phase 2, spawn agents for the following passes. Passes within the same review unit run **sequentially** (each builds on the prior). Passes for **different review units** run in parallel.

#### Pass 1: LEAK & SSOT Scan (Structural Pass)

**Goal**: Find all side logic, scattered knowledge, duplicated dispatch, and SSOT violations.

This pass reads the code structurally — it's looking for *where* logic lives relative to where it *should* live.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] **No duplicated dispatch**: match/if-chain on TypeTag, MethodKind, or operator kind exists ONLY at the canonical dispatch point? Any parallel match elsewhere is a LEAK — even if it produces correct results today.
- [ ] **No scattered knowledge**: type behavior (methods, operators, memory strategy) read from the registry, never hardcoded? Any `if type == X { special_behavior }` outside the canonical dispatcher is a LEAK.
- [ ] **No re-derived facts**: information computed by a prior phase is queried, not recomputed? Recomputing what's already stored creates a shadow source of truth.
- [ ] **No inline policy**: defaults, thresholds, format strings, validation rules defined at their canonical home, not at consumption sites? If changing a default requires grep-and-replace across files, it's a LEAK.
- [ ] **No validation at consumption**: invariants enforced at construction/entry, not checked at every use site? (parse-don't-validate)
- [ ] **No format logic outside formatters**: Display/Debug/diagnostic strings built in their formatting impls, not inline at error sites?
- [ ] **"Where would I look?" passes**: for every behavioral decision in this code, can you point to exactly ONE canonical location that defines it?
- [ ] **"What if it changes?" passes**: if the behavior changed, would exactly ONE file need updating (plus tests/docs)? If N > 1, it's a LEAK.
- [ ] **Canonical home exists**: for every behavioral decision, type relationship, or dispatch rule in this code — is there exactly ONE file that defines it? If the knowledge has no home (scattered everywhere), that's a structural SSOT violation.
- [ ] **No parallel authority**: are there two locations both claiming to define the same knowledge? (e.g., two match tables that both define "what methods does type X have?") Designate one as canonical, derive the other.
- [ ] **Consumers query, don't cache**: do consumers of shared knowledge call a function/query on the canonical owner, or do they maintain a local lookup table? Local tables are shadow homes.
- [ ] **Enforcement exists**: for every canonical source, is there a compile-time (exhaustive match) or test-time (exhaustiveness test) mechanism that catches consumers falling out of sync?
- [ ] **Architectural centers respected**: does this code correctly query from: registry (builtin behavior), type pool (type structure), AIMS (memory facts), repr-opt (representation)? Or does it re-derive what these centers already know?

#### Pass 2: Algorithmic DRY Scan (Pattern Pass)

**Goal**: Find duplicated algorithms — functions with identical control-flow skeletons that differ only in types, operations, or field names.

This pass reads the code *comparatively* — it's looking for structural similarity between function bodies, match arms, and dispatch tables. This is the hardest pass because it requires comparing code across files.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] **"Diff the bodies" test**: Read pairs of functions that handle similar cases (e.g., `dispatch_list_method` vs `dispatch_map_method`, `eval_iter_fold` vs `eval_iter_count`). Do their bodies differ only in type names, field names, or closure bodies while sharing the same control-flow skeleton?
- [ ] **"Count the steps" test**: Are there 3+ call sites that perform the same sequence of 2+ operations (even with different arguments)? Example: validate args → extract typed value → perform operation → wrap result.
- [ ] **"Cross-backend mirror" test**: Do eval and codegen maintain parallel dispatch tables, match arms, or routing logic with the same structure? Trace the method name through both backends — does each maintain its own routing independently?
- [ ] **"Match arm count" test**: Is the same enum/tag matched in N files with similar arm structure? If N > 2, N-1 of those are candidates for consolidation.
- [ ] **Threshold check**: 2 instances with >5 shared skeleton lines = extract. 3+ instances any size = extract. Cross-crate = always extract. Cross-backend = always extract to shared registry.
- [ ] **Remediation check**: For each algorithmic duplication found, identify the correct extraction: generic fn, higher-order fn, trait + blanket impl, data-driven dispatch, or (last resort) macro?

**How to execute this pass:**
1. For each crate, identify the major dispatch/routing functions (method dispatch, operator dispatch, type resolution, IR traversal)
2. Group structurally similar functions — same parameters shape, same loop/match/if structure
3. Read them side by side. Count the lines that are structurally identical vs. lines that differ.
4. If >60% structural overlap across 5+ lines: flag as `LEAK:algorithmic-duplication`
5. For cross-backend patterns, read the eval handler AND the LLVM emitter for the same feature — trace both paths

#### Pass 3: Boundary & Flow Scan (Plumbing Pass)

**Goal**: Find boundary violations, data flow issues, error handling gaps, and type discipline problems.

This pass reads the code *across boundaries* — it's looking at how data crosses phase lines.

**Checklist:**

**Phase Boundary Discipline:**
- [ ] Data flows one way? (no callbacks to earlier phase, no reaching back)
- [ ] No circular imports between phase crates?
- [ ] Boundary types are minimal? (only what's needed crosses)
- [ ] Clean ownership transfer? (move at boundaries, borrow within)
- [ ] No phase bleeding? (each phase does only its job)

**Data Flow:**
- [ ] Zero-copy where possible? (spans, not string copies)
- [ ] No allocation in hot paths? (no `String::from()` per token)
- [ ] Interned values via opaque IDs? (not raw integers)
- [ ] Source text borrowed, not copied?
- [ ] Arena/temporary data freed with phase?

**Error Handling at Boundaries:**
- [ ] Errors accumulated, not bailed on first?
- [ ] Phase-scoped error types? (lexer errors ≠ parse errors)
- [ ] Upstream errors propagated? (not swallowed or silently dropped)
- [ ] All errors carry spans?
- [ ] Recovery behavior explicit? (enum, not boolean flag)

**Type Discipline:**
- [ ] Separate raw vs cooked types at each boundary?
- [ ] Newtypes for all IDs crossing boundaries?
- [ ] No phase state leaked in output types? (no parser cursor in AST)
- [ ] Metadata separated from semantic data?

**Pass Composition (for optimization passes):**
- [ ] Each pass is IR → IR? (no hidden inputs)
- [ ] Pass ordering explicit and documented?
- [ ] No shared mutable state between passes?
- [ ] Boundary invariants asserted?

**Registration Sync Points:**
- [ ] Any enum/variant that must appear in multiple locations has a single source of truth?
- [ ] Parallel lists (match arms, arrays, maps) that must cover the same variants are derived from a shared source rather than manually mirrored?
- [ ] New variants added in one location are present in all parallel locations?
- [ ] When centralization isn't feasible, is there a test enforcing completeness?
- [ ] Operator→trait mappings, keyword→token mappings, error code→doc mappings — are these centralized or at risk of drift?

**Gap Detection:**
- [ ] Features supported in downstream phases also supported in upstream phases?
- [ ] No silent workarounds for missing capabilities?
- [ ] Full pipeline works end-to-end for each feature?

**Compiler-Specific Invariants:**
- [ ] **IR variant exhaustiveness**: New ExprKind/CanExpr/StmtKind variants handled in ALL consuming phases? No `_ => unreachable!()` catch-all arms hiding unhandled variants?
- [ ] **Cross-phase invariant contracts**: Does each phase boundary have explicit validation? ARC→Codegen: RC ops balanced? TypeCheck→Codegen: no unresolved type variables? Canon→All: no sugar variants, no TypeId::INFER?
- [ ] **Lowering completeness**: Every language construct lowered in BOTH eval AND LLVM codegen? No construct that works in one backend but crashes/panics in the other?
- [ ] **Span provenance**: Spans survive every lowering step (AST → CanExpr → ARC IR → LLVM IR)? No IR nodes with DUMMY spans outside of compiler-generated code?
- [ ] **Error recovery monotonicity**: TyError propagates silently without generating cascading diagnostics? Error nodes skipped (not re-diagnosed) by later phases?
- [ ] **Debug/release parity**: No `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` blocks that change semantics (only verification)? Both debug and release builds produce identical observable output?
- [ ] **Interning discipline**: All identifier comparisons use `Name` (not `String`)? All type comparisons use `Idx` (not structure)? No string-based identity checks in non-test code?
- [ ] **Layout computation**: Type layout computed once and cached, not recomputed per-consumer? Codegen queries layout facts, never re-derives from field types?
- [ ] **Strategy dispatch coverage**: Strategy tables (e.g., DeriveStrategy) cover all IR variants? Test iterating ALL variants asserts each has a strategy entry?

#### Pass 4: Surface Hygiene Scan (Polish Pass)

**Goal**: Find file organization violations, naming issues, comment problems, visibility leaks, and style violations.

This pass reads the code *locally* — each file on its own terms.

**Checklist:**

**File Organization:**
- [ ] All production source files under 500 lines? (test files exempt)
- [ ] Each file has a single clear responsibility?
- [ ] Logical groups of 200+ lines within a file extracted to submodules?
- [ ] File names describe what the file does?
- [ ] Directory structure mirrors the logical phase/pass structure?

**Plan Annotation Hygiene:**
- [ ] Run `plan-annotations.sh --scope <review-paths>` (in this skill's folder) to scan the review scope. The tool classifies each annotation as **stale-resolved** (ID is `[x]` in an active plan — REMOVE NOW), **stale-completed-plan** (ID is in an archived plan under `plans/completed/` — REMOVE NOW), **orphan** (ID references a plan that no longer exists — INVESTIGATE), **active-scaffolding** (ID is `[ ]` in an active plan — OK for now), or **permanent** (spec citations, architecture-internal). Use `--cleanup-only` to see just the removal candidates; `--active-only` to confirm what's being tracked as in-progress; `--orphans-only` to find broken references; `--all --count` for a full per-classification summary. The tool reads every plan's markdown content to build the ID→status map, so classifications are per-finding accurate.
- [ ] For a quick hygiene-review scope check: `plan-annotations.sh --scope <paths> --cleanup-only` lists stale annotations grouped by finding ID, each showing the plan file and line where the finding was resolved. Every group is directly actionable.
- [ ] **Ephemeral names in function/fixture names** are also scanned automatically: `plan-annotations.sh --cleanup-only` now includes an `EPHEMERAL NAMES` section that catches underscore-form IDs baked into `fn` names (e.g., `fn tpr_07_017_two_unrelated_...`) and `include_str!` fixture paths. These are classified with the same stale/active logic as comment annotations but require *renaming* (not comment stripping) — the output includes `[fn]`/`[fixture]` tags and the full name for each hit.
- [ ] Active plan annotations (classification `active-scaffolding`) are acceptable only while the specific finding checkbox is `[ ]`; flip to stale the instant the checkbox becomes `[x]`
- [ ] Spec references (`Spec: Clause N.M`), `AIMS Section N`, and `eval_v2 Section N` are permanent and always acceptable (classified as `permanent` / `arch-internal` by the tool)

**Unsafe & FFI (for `oriterm_ipc` Unix/Windows transports, `oriterm_mux` PTY, and any `crates/wgpu-hal` / `crates/portable-pty` integration):**
- [ ] `unsafe_code = "deny"` at workspace level — any `unsafe` block must be in a `#[allow]`-ed boundary module with justification.
- [ ] Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment explaining the invariants the caller upholds.
- [ ] Unsafe scope minimized — prefer safe wrappers over inlined unsafe at call sites.
- [ ] FFI / platform calls use `std::ffi` types (`c_char`, `c_int`, `OsStr`) never raw primitives.
- [ ] Every `#[cfg(target_os = ...)]` FFI branch has counterparts on all three supported targets (Linux / macOS / Windows).

**Naming, Comments, Visibility, Style:**
- [ ] Phase-specific verb prefixes used? (cook_, parse_, check_, eval_, emit_)
- [ ] Spec citations on non-obvious language semantics implementations?
- [ ] No decorative banners, no commented-out code, no bare TODOs?
- [ ] Functions < 100 lines? Nesting depth ≤ 4?
- [ ] pub(crate)/pub(super) used appropriately? No dead pub items?

**Test Function Naming** (NAMING category — violations MUST be renamed in this review, never deferred):
- [ ] Every test name follows `<subject>_<scenario>_<expected>` shape — self-explanatory without looking at the body or any external artifact?
- [ ] No ephemeral identifiers in test names? Scan test function names (`#[test] fn ...` in Rust; `@test ... tests @target` in Ori) for:
  - Plan names (`locality_repr`, `repr_opt`, `capability_unification`, etc.)
  - Section / subsection numbers (`section_04_3`, `4_3_2`, `§4_3`, `04_2_phase_b`)
  - Plan annotations (`TPR_04_005`, `CROSS_04_014`, `roadmap_04`)
  - Bug / issue IDs (`BUG_04_045`, `issue_42`, `bug042`, `fix_2031`)
  - Dates (`2026_03_15`, `march_fix`, `q1_regression`)
  - Author initials (`eric_fix`, `es_repro`)
  - Commit hashes / ticket refs
- [ ] No banned weak descriptors? `_works`, `_works_correctly`, `_basic`, `_simple`, `_default`, `_correct`, `_valid`, `_ok`, `_sanity`, `_handles_X`, `_check_X`, `_verify_X`, or bare unit names (`test_iterator`, `test_parse_function`, `test_eval`).
- [ ] Provenance lives in `///` (Rust) or `//` (Ori) doc comments above the test, never in the function name?
- [ ] **Action on any violation found**: rename the test in the same pass. Extract the behavioral scenario from the test body, build a new name from it, move any useful plan/bug/issue provenance into a `///` doc comment above the test. The rename is local to the test file (test names have no callers) — scope, complexity, and "it's just a test" are not valid reasons to defer.

**Automated detection** (handled by Phase 0 tools — verify output, don't re-scan manually):
- `hygiene-lint.py --check test-ephemeral,test-weak` detects both ephemeral IDs and weak descriptors in test names
- `plan-annotations.sh --cleanup-only` detects ephemeral IDs classified against the plan index (stale vs active)
- `fn-rename.py` can batch-rename violations found by the above tools

Results from tools are **candidate violations** — read each one before renaming (a test named `test_cow_default_value_clone` legitimately contains `default` as a domain word, not a weak descriptor). The NAMING category requires *behavioral* judgment, not just grep matches.

Full rules: `.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md` §Test Function Naming.

### Phase 4: Third-Party Cross-Check

**MANDATORY for full project mode. Recommended for all other modes.**

After Phase 3 agents return their findings, use `/tp-help` to cross-check the work. This creates a **three-brain review**: you found the patterns, now BOTH Codex AND Gemini independently validate them and look for what you missed. `/tp-help` is dual-source concat mode — a single call returns Codex + Gemini responses concatenated with attribution sentinels. Silently ignoring one reviewer's half of the response is a contract violation.

**Trust tiers (per the global reviewer-grounding rule):**
- **Codex** — HIGH trust: spot-check findings against actual code, move on if they hold
- **Gemini** — LOWER trust: confabulation-prone; independently verify EVERY claim against actual code before acting. Gemini is valuable for catching angles Codex missed, not as an authoritative source.
- The `/tp-help` prompt MUST instruct both reviewers to read `CLAUDE.md` and all `.claude/rules/*.md` (especially `impl-hygiene.md`) FIRST before reviewing.

#### 4a. Validate Findings

Invoke `/tp-help` with a focused question. Pass a summary of 5-10 of the most significant findings (not all — pick the ones that are most ambiguous or architecturally significant) and ask both reviewers to validate:

```
/tp-help BEFORE reviewing, read CLAUDE.md and .claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md. I'm running a hygiene review of [scope]. Here are my top findings — validate whether these are real violations or false positives, and tell me if I'm missing anything obvious in these areas:

[List of 5-10 findings with file:line and brief description]

Key files involved: [list the main files]
```

**What to do with the response (evaluate Codex and Gemini INDEPENDENTLY first, then look for cross-reviewer patterns):**

Per-reviewer evaluation — for Codex AND Gemini separately:
- If the reviewer confirms a finding: verify the confirmation against code (spot-check for Codex, full verification for Gemini per trust tier), then increase confidence and keep the finding
- If the reviewer challenges a finding: re-read the code, check if you misunderstood the pattern. Update or drop the finding ONLY if code verification shows the challenge is correct
- If the reviewer surfaces NEW findings you missed: verify each one against actual code, then add the verified ones to the findings list

Cross-reviewer pattern analysis:
- **Both reviewers confirm the same finding**: highest-signal agreement — lock in, prioritize in severity calibration
- **Both reviewers challenge the same finding**: STRONG signal you misread the pattern — re-verify against code before dropping
- **Reviewers disagree with each other on the same finding**: investigate deeper — read the code end-to-end, determine which framing holds, and do NOT silently pick the answer you prefer
- **One reviewer surfaces a finding the other missed**: treat as valid after your own code verification — Gemini often catches angles Codex doesn't and vice versa (that's the whole point of dual-source)

#### 4b. Probe Blind Spots

After validating findings, use `/tp-help` again to probe areas you might have under-examined. Ask both reviewers to look at a specific area you didn't go deep on:

```
/tp-help BEFORE reviewing, read CLAUDE.md and .claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md. I reviewed [scope] and found [N] findings, but I'm worried I may have missed algorithmic duplication in [specific area]. Can you compare [file A] and [file B] structurally and tell me if their control-flow skeletons are duplicated?
```

Or for cross-backend duplication:

```
/tp-help BEFORE reviewing, read CLAUDE.md and .claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md. Compare the eval path for [feature] in [eval file] with the LLVM codegen path in [llvm file]. Are these maintaining parallel dispatch tables that should be unified?
```

Read BOTH reviewers' sections of the concatenated response in full — do not skim one to "confirm" the other.

**When to probe:**
- Any crate that yielded zero findings (suspiciously clean — likely under-examined)
- Cross-backend code (eval ↔ LLVM) — hardest to catch because it requires reading two codebases in parallel
- Large match/dispatch functions — easy to skim past structural duplication when arms look "different enough"
- Code paths you traced superficially (read the entry point but not the helpers)

#### 4c. Integrate Cross-Check Results

Merge BOTH reviewers' validated and newly-surfaced findings back into the main findings list. Tag findings that any reviewer confirmed with `[TP-CONFIRMED-codex]`, `[TP-CONFIRMED-gemini]`, or `[TP-CONFIRMED-both]` (when both independently confirmed it). Tag findings that either reviewer surfaced with `[TP-SURFACED-codex]` or `[TP-SURFACED-gemini]` — attribution matters both for prioritization and for the severity bump in §5c. Per trust tiers: every Gemini-originated claim (confirmed or surfaced) must be verified against actual code before being integrated — do NOT pass through unverified Gemini claims.

### Phase 5: Compile & Present Findings

Collect the findings from all passes across all review units. This is synthesis, not just concatenation.

#### 5a. Deduplicate

Same violation caught by multiple passes → keep the deepest analysis, drop the others.

#### 5b. Cross-Reference

Look for patterns across findings:
- **Cluster analysis**: 5+ findings in one module = design problem (escalate to architectural review)
- **3+ LEAKs in one module** = systemic side logic; the module lacks a canonical dispatch/query point
- **Same algorithm duplicated across N files** = missing abstraction (report as a single finding, not N findings)
- **Cross-backend findings** = highest priority; these drift silently

#### 5c. Severity Calibration

Apply default severities from the finding categories, then adjust:
- **LEAK:algorithmic-duplication** across 3+ sites → Critical (not just because it's a LEAK, but because the blast radius of protocol change is proportional to copy count)
- **Cross-backend LEAKs** → always Critical (eval ↔ LLVM dispatch drift is a correctness risk, not just a maintainability concern)
- Findings tagged `[TP-CONFIRMED-codex]`, `[TP-CONFIRMED-gemini]`, or `[TP-CONFIRMED-both]` → keep severity (with `-both` agreement a strong correctness signal that may warrant a priority boost inside the same severity tier). Findings tagged `[TP-SURFACED-codex]` or `[TP-SURFACED-gemini]` → bump severity one level (an independent reviewer caught what you missed, which means it's less obvious and more likely to be missed again). Per trust tiers, every `-gemini` bump is conditional on you having independently verified the claim against actual code.

#### 5d. Present to User

Present findings organized by category and severity, with a summary preamble:

```
## Hygiene Review: [scope]

**Scope**: [crates/boundaries reviewed]
**Passes**: LEAK/SSOT, Algorithmic DRY, Boundary/Flow, Surface Hygiene
**Third-party cross-check**: [Yes/No] — [N confirmed, M surfaced]
**Finding counts**: [N LEAK, N DRIFT, N GAP, N WASTE, N EXPOSURE, N BLOAT]

### Active Plan Context
[Plans read and their relevance]

### Critical Findings (LEAKs)
...

### Major Findings (DRIFT, GAP)
...

### Minor Findings (WASTE, EXPOSURE, BLOAT)
...
```

### Phase 6: Generate Plan (Separate Agent)

Spawn a **separate Agent** to generate the fix plan. This agent should use `/create-plan` (via the **Skill** tool). Pass it:

1. **All compiled findings** from Phase 5
2. **The plan name**: `hygiene-{target-short-name}` (e.g., `hygiene-ori-types`, `hygiene-lexer-parser`, `hygiene-last-commit`, `hygiene-full`)
3. **The mission statement** — The plan's `## Mission` MUST express the architectural end state, not enumerate findings. The mission is about what the code should **become**: a cohesive architecture with clean design, clear phase boundaries, correct solutions, and every piece of knowledge in its canonical home. Then describe the **specific design problems** in each area — what's architecturally wrong, not category counts. The standard is `.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md`.

   **Pattern:**
   > Achieve {architectural end state description}. This sweep addresses {area A} — where {design problem in A}; {area B} — where {design problem in B}; and {area C} — where {design problem in C}. The standard is `.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md`.

   **Rules:**
   - Frame as the **architectural destination**, not a task manifest — "cohesive architecture with clean design and correct solutions", not "eliminate N LEAKs"
   - Describe each area's **design problem** — "scattered damage-tracking state with no canonical dispatch", not "5 LEAK findings in oriterm_core"
   - Finding counts, category breakdowns, and priority ordering belong in `## Metrics`, NOT in the mission
   - The mission must read as a design vision that someone could evaluate the code against when the work is done

The agent should create a plan that:

1. Lists every LEAK, DRIFT, GAP, WASTE, EXPOSURE, and BLOAT finding with `file:line` references
2. Groups by boundary (e.g., "lexer→parser", "parser→types") or by violation type for full-project mode
3. Estimates scope: "N boundaries, ~M findings"
4. Orders: **LEAKs first and separately** (side logic is the root of all evil — every LEAK is a ticking architectural bomb), then drift (sync), then gaps (feature coverage), then bloat (file organization), then waste (perf), then exposure (type safety). LEAKs must NEVER be deferred — they cascade.
5. **Algorithmic duplication findings get their own section** — these often require coordinated multi-file refactoring (extracting a shared helper, adding a generic function, creating a data-driven dispatch table). Group by the algorithm being duplicated, not by where the copies live.

The **final section** of the plan must be a cleanup step:

```markdown
## Cleanup

- [ ] Run `cargo test --all` to verify no behavior changes
- [ ] Run `cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings` to verify no regressions
- [ ] Delete this plan directory: `rm -rf plans/hygiene-{name}/`
```

Hygiene fix plans are disposable — they exist to track the fixes, then get deleted when complete.

### Plan Section Format

Each section groups findings by boundary or violation cluster:

```
## {Boundary: Phase A → Phase B}

**Interface types:** {list types crossing this boundary}
**Entry points:** {list key functions}

### Active Plan Context

{List each plan file read and its relevance. If a plan has a reroute/suspension, note it here.}
- `plans/trait_arch/` — Active reroute: all roadmap work suspended until trait architecture refactor completes
- (none) — if no plan files were found

### Findings

1. **[LEAK:duplicated-dispatch]** `file:line` — {description} — **canonical home**: `{canonical_file:line}`
2. **[LEAK:algorithmic-duplication]** `file_a:line` ↔ `file_b:line` — {description of shared skeleton} — **extraction**: {generic fn / HOF / trait / data-driven / macro}
3. **[LEAK:scattered-knowledge]** `file:line` — {description} — **canonical home**: `{canonical_file:line}`
4. **[DRIFT]** `file:line` — {description}
   → covered by plans/{plan}/ ({section name})
5. **[DRIFT] [PLANNED]** `file:line` — {description}
   → fix described in plans/{plan}/{section}.md
6. **[GAP]** `file:line` — {description}
7. **[WASTE]** `file:line` — {description}
8. **[EXPOSURE]** `file:line` — {description}
```

## Important Rules

1. **No architecture changes** — Don't propose new phases, new IRs, or restructured crate graphs
2. **Full scope** — Phase boundaries, data flow, naming, comments, visibility, file organization, lint discipline, unsafe hygiene, algorithmic DRY, and code fixes are all in scope. Only new phases, IRs, or crate graph restructures are out of scope (that's architecture).
3. **Trace, don't grep** — Follow actual data flow through the code, don't just search for patterns
4. **Read both sides** — Always read both the producer and consumer of a boundary
5. **Compare function bodies** — For algorithmic DRY, you must read pairs/groups of structurally similar functions side by side. Grepping for names is not enough — you need to compare control-flow skeletons.
6. **Understand before flagging** — Some apparent violations are intentional (e.g., lexer tracking nesting depth for nested comments is acceptable phase-local state, not phase bleeding)
7. **Be specific** — Every finding must have `file:line`, the boundary it violates, and a concrete fix
8. **Compare to reference compilers** — When in doubt, check how Rust/Zig/Go/Gleam handle the same boundary at `~/projects/reference_repos/lang_repos/`
9. **Cross-check with /tp-help** — For full project mode: MANDATORY. For other modes: RECOMMENDED. Always validate ambiguous findings and probe blind spots. A hygiene review that doesn't question its own completeness is incomplete.
10. **Follow the algorithm, not the name** — Two functions named differently but with identical control-flow skeletons are duplicated. Two functions named similarly but with genuinely different logic are not. Read bodies, not signatures.

## Finding Targets

Finding targets scale with scope. These are **minimums** — dig deep, read broadly, trace more paths. Do NOT fabricate, exaggerate, or inflate findings to hit the target — every finding must be real and verifiable. If the target area genuinely has fewer issues, report what you find honestly and note the shortfall.

| Mode | Minimum Findings | Expected Range |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Single boundary or single crate | 20 | 20-35 |
| Multi-crate or last N commits spanning multiple crates | 40 | 40-60 |
| Full project | 80 | 80-120 |
| Full project with --focus | 60 (focused category) + 30 (other categories) | 60-100 focused + 30-50 other |

**Algorithmic DRY findings count as high-value** — a single algorithmic duplication finding that spans 5 files is worth more than 5 individual surface hygiene findings. Quality over quantity, but quantity matters too because thoroughness is the point.
