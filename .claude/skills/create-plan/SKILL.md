# Create Plan Command

Create a new plan directory with index and section files using the standard plan schema. **Research-first, architecture-second, sections-last**: deeply understand the existing codebase, design the architecture, then write sections sequentially.

**Schema**: `.claude/skills/create-plan/plan-schema.md` — the single source of truth for plan structure, frontmatter fields, section format, status conventions, and writing principles.

## Usage

```
/create-plan <name> [description]
/create-plan <add xyz to roadmap>
/create-plan add "<subsection title>" subsection to plans/<plan-dir>
```

- `name`: Directory name for the plan (kebab-case, e.g., `error-recovery`, `lsp-integration`)
- `description`: Optional one-line description of the plan's goal
- **Existing plan mode**: If the input references an existing plan directory (e.g., "add X to plans/repr-opt", "add section to roadmap"), this command operates in **Existing Plan Mode** — see the dedicated section below.

**Output directory override**: Set `ORI_PLAN_ROOT` to redirect plan output to a different root directory. When set, all plan files are written under `$ORI_PLAN_ROOT/{name}/` instead of `plans/{name}/`. Default behavior (no env var) is unchanged. This is primarily for test harnesses that need to exercise `/create-plan` non-destructively without writing into the repo's `plans/` directory.

---

## Mode Detection

**New Plan Mode** (default): The argument names a new plan directory. Creates `plans/{name}/` from scratch.

**Existing Plan Mode**: The argument indicates adding a section or subsection to an existing plan. Detected when:
- The input contains "roadmap" or references an existing roadmap section (legacy Roadmap Mode — operates on `plans/roadmap/`)
- The input references any existing plan directory (e.g., "add X to plans/repr-opt", "add subsection to plans/test-suite-health")
- The input uses the explicit syntax: `add "<title>" subsection to plans/<dir>`

When in Existing Plan Mode, the target is the referenced plan directory. See "Existing Plan Mode" section below for the full workflow.

Both modes follow the SAME research rigor, the SAME iterative deepening, the SAME sequential writing discipline. The difference is the target: a new plan vs. an existing one.

---

## Design Principles

These principles govern the entire plan creation process. When in doubt, consult these:

1. **Research depth > research breadth** — One agent that reads 15 files thoroughly beats 5 agents that scan 50 files superficially. Understanding invariants, control flow, and edge cases matters more than listing type signatures.

2. **Architecture before sections** — The overview isn't boilerplate. It's the load-bearing design document. Sections are *implementations of* the architecture, not independent documents. Design first, detail second.

3. **Sequential section writing is non-negotiable** — Sections depend on each other. Section 3 references decisions made in Section 2. Parallel writing forces each section to *guess* what other sections decided, producing contradictions. Write one section at a time, in order.

4. **User checkpoints at design-level decisions** — Don't ask the user to review 8 completed sections. Ask them to review the architecture *first*, then write sections they've already conceptually agreed to.

5. **Iterative deepening over parallel breadth** — Start wide, then go deep on what matters. Each research pass builds on the findings of the prior pass.

6. **External consultations are SEQUENTIAL and FOREGROUND** — All `/tp-help` and `/tpr-review` invocations MUST run in the foreground (NOT `run_in_background`). MUST wait for each to complete and read its output before proceeding. NEVER launch them in parallel with each other or with other agents/skills. The pipeline is sequential by design — each consultation's feedback informs the next step.

7. **Rules are woven in, not assumed** — Plans cannot assume the implementer has CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/*.md` loaded in context. Every section must embed the specific rules that govern its work — TDD discipline, file size limits, crate ordering, test conventions, phase boundaries, registration sync requirements. The plan is a self-contained execution document. If a rule applies to a section's work, it must appear in that section — either as a checklist constraint, a callout, or an inline requirement. The goal is for rules to appear organically as part of the work description, not as a separate "rules to follow" appendix.

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites

### Step 0: Read CLAUDE.md (ABSOLUTE FIRST — NO EXCEPTIONS)

**Before doing ANYTHING else**, read the ENTIRE CLAUDE.md file — every single word, top to bottom:

```
Read file: CLAUDE.md
```

This is mandatory. Do not skip, skim, or partially read. The rules in CLAUDE.md govern ALL behavior in this command. Proceed to Step 1 only after reading the complete file.

### Step 1: Gather Initial Scope

If not provided via arguments, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:

1. **Plan name** — kebab-case directory name
2. **Plan title** — Human-readable title (e.g., "Error Recovery System")
3. **Goal** — One-line description of what this plan accomplishes
4. **Rough scope** — Which parts of the compiler/runtime/stdlib does this touch? (crates, subsystems, features)

Do NOT ask for sections yet. Sections emerge from research, not from guessing.

### Step 1B: Mission Expansion

The user's input is typically a generic, high-level mission statement. Your job is to expand it into a **full executable mission statement** before any research or plan creation begins.

Take the user's rough goal and expand it into:

1. **Concrete scope**: What crates, subsystems, files, and features are in scope? What's explicitly out?
2. **Deliverables**: What specific, verifiable outcomes does this plan produce? (Not "improve X" — "X does Y where it currently does Z")
3. **Success criteria**: How do you know the mission is complete? What tests pass? What behavior changes?
4. **Boundaries**: What does this plan NOT do? Where does it hand off to other plans or future work?

**Scoping discipline — CRITICAL:**

The compiler is under active development. Plans exist to build out the compiler's feature set. Scoping must reflect this reality:

**Valid reasons to scope something OUT:**
- It doesn't fit Ori's design philosophy — would feel tacked on, not organic to the language
- It doesn't improve the compiler meaningfully — busywork with no architectural payoff
- It's architecturally incoherent with the existing design direction
- It belongs in a different plan that addresses a different subsystem (but must be cross-linked as a dependency)

**INVALID reasons to scope something out:**
- "The type checker doesn't support X yet" — that's a blocker to resolve (Step 1C), not a scope exclusion
- "The codegen can't handle Y" — same: blocker, not scope
- "We'd need to add Z infrastructure first" — same: blocker, not scope
- Any "missing prerequisite" or "missing feature" argument — if we always scoped out features because prerequisites were missing, no features would ever get built. Missing prerequisites are what Step 1C (Blocker Identification) captures and what the plan resolves.

When evaluating scope, ask: "Is this being excluded because it doesn't belong in Ori, or because building it requires work?" Only the first is valid. The second is the plan's job.

### Step 1C: Blocker Identification

The mission must remove any blockers in its way. Before the mission can be fulfilled, you must identify what stands between the current codebase state and the mission's goals.

1. **Identify blockers**: What existing bugs, missing features, incomplete infrastructure, or broken subsystems would prevent the mission from being fulfilled?
2. **Check existing tracking**: For each blocker, search:
   - `plans/roadmap/` — is it a roadmap item? Which section?
   - `plans/bug-tracker/` — is it a tracked bug? Which entry?
   - Other `plans/*/` directories — is it queued in another plan? Which section?
   - CLAUDE.md memory entries — is it a known issue?
3. **Resolution strategy**: For each blocker:
   - If tracked elsewhere: this plan MUST include executing/resolving the blocker. Add it as a section or checklist item. When complete, update the original location (roadmap section, bug-tracker entry, other plan) as resolved with a cross-link back to this plan's section.
   - If not tracked anywhere: this plan owns it entirely. Add it as a section or checklist item.
   - If the blocker is too large to include (would double the plan's scope): flag it via `AskUserQuestion` — the user decides whether to expand scope or split into prerequisite plans.
4. **Cross-link format**: When resolving a blocker from another plan, add `<!-- resolved-by: plans/{this-plan}/section-NN -->` to the original location, and `<!-- resolves: plans/{other-plan}/section-MM item description -->` to this plan's item.

### Step 1D: Consensus Loop with Codex (MANDATORY — ITERATE UNTIL AGREEMENT)

**SEQUENTIAL & FOREGROUND — MANDATORY.** Every `/tp-help` call in this loop MUST run in the foreground (NOT `run_in_background`). You MUST wait for each to complete and read its output before proceeding. Do NOT launch these in parallel with any other agent or skill invocation.

This is not a single consultation — it is a **consensus loop**. You and Codex iterate on the mission's direction, approach, and integration points until you reach genuine agreement. The loop runs until one of two outcomes:

1. **Consensus reached**: You and Codex agree on how the plan integrates with Ori's architecture, what the approach should be, and that it's a good fit.
2. **Agreed rejection**: You and Codex both agree that part or all of the proposed direction is not a good fit for Ori — in which case, document why and propose an alternative direction.

**Loop protocol:**

**Round 1** — Present the full picture to Codex:

Build a `/tp-help` prompt that includes:
- The user's original generic mission statement
- Your expanded mission (scope, deliverables, success criteria, boundaries) from Step 1B
- The identified blockers and their resolution strategy from Step 1C
- Your proposed direction and approach — how does this integrate with Ori's existing architecture?
- Any open questions or uncertainties

Ask Codex specifically:
- "Is this mission statement complete and executable? Are there gaps?"
- "Are the identified blockers comprehensive, or am I missing dependencies?"
- "Is the scope right — too broad, too narrow, or just right for a single plan?"
- "Does this direction integrate well with Ori's architecture? Where are the natural integration points?"
- "What would you change about the approach?"

**Round 2+** — Respond to Codex's feedback:

After each Codex response, evaluate:
- **Points of agreement**: Lock these in. They become part of the consensus.
- **Points of disagreement**: For each, either (a) accept Codex's point and update the mission, or (b) push back with specific reasoning and ask Codex to reconsider. Do NOT silently ignore disagreements.
- **New concerns raised**: Address each one. If Codex identified a blocker or integration issue you missed, incorporate it.
- **Integration fit**: If Codex questions whether something fits Ori, engage seriously — is there a better organic integration point? Or is this genuinely not the right approach?
- **Scoping pushback**: If Codex suggests scoping something out because "the compiler doesn't support X yet" or "Y infrastructure is missing," push back — those are blockers to resolve, not scope exclusions. The only valid reason to exclude something is that it doesn't fit Ori's design. Missing prerequisites are what the plan exists to build.

Call `/tp-help` again with:
- What you agree on so far (locked-in consensus points)
- What you're still iterating on (with your response to Codex's feedback)
- Updated mission statement reflecting changes from this round
- Specific questions for the remaining disagreements

**Loop termination**: The loop ends when BOTH of these are true:
- You and Codex agree on the mission direction, scope, approach, and integration points (or agree that something should be excluded and why)
- There are no unresolved disagreements or open questions between you

**Do NOT cap the loop at a fixed number of rounds.** Most missions will converge in 2-3 rounds. Some may take 4-5. The loop runs until consensus, not until a counter expires.

**After consensus**, compile the results:

1. **Consensus points**: What you and Codex agreed on — direction, approach, integration points, scope
2. **Rejected directions**: What you both agreed is not a good fit for Ori, and why
3. **Draft execution outline**: A preliminary sketch of how the plan will be executed — approximate section structure, rough ordering, key phases. This is a draft (full planning hasn't run yet), but it gives the user a sense of shape:
   - What gets built first (foundation/prerequisites)
   - What the core implementation phases are
   - What integration/verification looks like
   - Where the major risks and decision points are

### Step 1E: Mission Proposal to User

**MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP.** Use `AskUserQuestion` to present the consensus results to the user for approval before proceeding.

Present:
1. **Original input**: What the user said
2. **Expanded mission**: The full executable mission statement (scope, deliverables, success criteria, boundaries)
3. **Claude + Codex consensus**: What was agreed on — direction, approach, integration points. Present this as a unified position, not a transcript. The user should see what was decided and why.
4. **Rejected directions** (if any): What was considered and ruled out as not fitting Ori, with reasoning
5. **Identified blockers**: Each blocker, where it's currently tracked (if anywhere), and how this plan will resolve it
6. **Cross-plan impacts**: Which other plans/roadmap items will be updated as resolved when this plan executes
7. **Draft execution outline**: The preliminary plan shape — section structure, ordering, phases. Flag this as a draft that will be refined during the full research and planning phases.

Ask: "Does this mission and approach accurately capture what you want? Any adjustments to the direction, scope, or approach before I proceed with research and plan creation?"

**Do NOT proceed to Step 2 until the user approves the mission.** If they redirect or adjust, go back to Step 1B with the new direction and repeat Steps 1C-1E (including the consensus loop).

### Step 2: Read the Template & Hygiene Rules

Read `.claude/skills/create-plan/plan-schema.md` for the structure reference.

The full rule set is embedded below (source of truth files — do not maintain separate copies). Use these rules when structuring plan sections to ensure plans account for registration sync points, file size limits, phase boundary discipline, and other hygiene requirements from the start.

**Hygiene Rules** (`.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md`):
@.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md

**Compiler Guidelines** (`.claude/rules/compiler.md`):
@.claude/rules/compiler.md

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Pass Research (MANDATORY — NO SHORTCUTS)

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PHASE.** You MUST deeply understand the existing codebase before designing architecture or writing sections. Every claim in the plan must be grounded to actual code — no assumptions, no guessing.

Research uses **iterative deepening** — four sequential passes, each building on the findings of the prior pass. Passes 1 and 2 may use parallel agents for breadth. Passes 3 and 4 are focused, sequential deep-dives.

### Step 3: Pass 1 — Breadth Scan (parallel agents)

Launch **2-4 parallel agents** to build an inventory of everything relevant. This pass answers: **what exists?**

**Every agent MUST be instructed to:**
- Read actual source files (not just file names)
- Report exact file paths, line numbers, function signatures, type definitions
- Report what EXISTS today — not what they think should exist
- Flag anything ambiguous or surprising as `UNCLEAR: {what}`
- NO assumptions — if something is unclear, say so rather than guessing

Tailor agents to the specific plan topic. Standard agents:

#### Agent 1: Implementation & Boundary Survey

```
You are researching the Ori compiler codebase for plan creation. Your job is to build a complete inventory of everything related to: {topic/scope}.

Read CLAUDE.md first.

PART A — Implementation Inventory:
1. Find ALL files, types, functions, traits, and modules related to {topic}
   - Use Glob to find files by name patterns
   - Use Grep to find type/function/trait definitions
   - READ the actual source code of every file you find (not just names)
2. For each relevant file, report:
   - Full path
   - Line count (total, production, test)
   - Key types/structs/enums defined (with field signatures)
   - Key functions (with full signatures)
   - Imports and dependencies (what does this file depend on?)
   - Exports (what does this file expose to other crates?)
3. Report ALL existing tests for this area:
   - Test file locations and what each test covers
   - Any #[ignore] tests and their reasons
   - Gaps in test coverage you notice

PART B — Integration Points & Boundaries:
1. Identify every crate that {topic} touches or will need to touch
2. For each crate boundary:
   - What types cross the boundary? (Read the actual pub types)
   - What functions are called across the boundary? (Read actual call sites)
   - What registration/sync points exist? (enums, match arms, if-chains that must stay in sync)
3. Map the full pipeline flow for {topic}:
   - Lexer → Parser → IR → Types → Eval → LLVM → Runtime
   - At each stage, what representation does {topic} have?
   - Where are the hand-off points?
4. Check for registration sync requirements:
   - Enum variants that must be added in multiple places
   - Match arms that must stay in sync
   - Test arrays/lists that enumerate all variants
   - Registry entries that must be updated

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each file:
  PATH: {full path}
  LINES: {count}
  KEY TYPES: {list with signatures}
  KEY FUNCTIONS: {list with signatures}
  DEPENDENCIES: {what it imports}
  EXPORTS: {what it exposes}
  TESTS: {test file path and coverage summary}
  NOTES: {anything surprising, unclear, or noteworthy}

Then:
  CRATES_TOUCHED: {list}
  BOUNDARY_TYPES: {for each boundary, the types that cross it}
  PIPELINE_FLOW: {stage-by-stage representation}
  SYNC_POINTS: {every enum/match/registry that must stay in sync}
  UNCLEAR: {list of anything you couldn't determine}
  EXISTING_BUGS: {any bugs or issues you noticed while reading}
```

#### Agent 2: Tests, Spec, & Hygiene Audit

```
You are researching the Ori compiler codebase for plan creation. Your job is to understand the test landscape, spec requirements, and hygiene state for {topic/scope}.

Read CLAUDE.md first, then read .claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md and .claude/rules/compiler.md.

PART A — Tests & Spec:
1. Find ALL existing tests related to {topic}:
   - Rust unit tests (tests.rs files)
   - Rust integration tests (ori_llvm/tests/aot/)
   - Ori spec tests (tests/spec/)
   - Valgrind tests (tests/valgrind/)
   - Read the actual test code, not just file names
2. Check the spec:
   - Read relevant sections of docs/spec/
   - Read grammar.ebnf for syntax rules
   - Read operator-rules.md if operators are involved
   - Report what the spec says about this topic
3. Check existing plans:
   - Read plans/ directory for related or superseded plans
   - Report any existing plan items that overlap with this topic
   - Report any completed plan items that this plan builds on
4. Check CLAUDE.md and memory for relevant context

PART B — Hygiene Audit:
1. Find all files that will likely be touched based on the scope: {topic}
2. For EACH file, report:
   - Full path and line count
   - Whether it exceeds the 500-line limit
   - Any existing TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs, WORKAROUNDs
   - Any dead code or stale comments you notice
   - Any registration sync points that are already out of sync
3. Check for phase boundary violations:
   - Does any file import from a crate it shouldn't?
   - Is internal state leaking through boundary types?
4. Check test file conventions:
   - Are tests in sibling tests.rs files (not inline)?
   - Any #[cfg(test)] mod tests blocks that should be extracted?
5. Produce a hygiene summary:
   - Clean files (no issues)
   - Files with issues (categorized: BLOAT/WASTE/DRIFT/EXPOSURE/LEAK/STYLE)
   - Priority files that need splitting before the plan can proceed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  EXISTING_TESTS: {list with paths and coverage}
  SPEC_REQUIREMENTS: {what the spec mandates}
  RELATED_PLANS: {existing plans that overlap}
  FILES_TOUCHED: {list with line counts}
  OVER_LIMIT: {files > 500 lines}
  HYGIENE_ISSUES: {categorized findings with file:line}
  SYNC_VIOLATIONS: {any already-broken sync points}
  PRIORITY_SPLITS: {files that must be split before work begins}
  UNCLEAR: {anything ambiguous}
  EXISTING_BUGS: {bugs found in tests, spec compliance, or hygiene}
```

#### Agent 3: Runtime & Codegen State (if the plan touches runtime/LLVM)

```
You are researching the Ori compiler codebase for plan creation. Your job is to understand the runtime and codegen state for {topic/scope}.

Read CLAUDE.md first.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the relevant runtime code in crates/$1/src/:
   - What C-ABI functions exist for this feature?
   - What data layouts are used?
   - What memory management patterns (RC inc/dec, COW, SSO)?
2. Read the relevant codegen code in crates/$1/src/:
   - How is this feature lowered to LLVM IR?
   - What builtins are emitted?
   - How does the ARC pipeline interact?
3. Read the ARC pipeline if relevant (crates/$1/src/):
   - How does the optimizer analyze this feature?
   - What contracts/lattice states apply?
   - What rewrite rules fire?
4. Check for eval/LLVM divergence:
   - Compare ori_eval handling with ori_llvm handling
   - Are there known behavioral differences?
   - Grep for TODO|FIXME|HACK|WORKAROUND in relevant files
5. Check diagnostic scripts:
   - What diagnostic tools exist for this area?
   - What environment variables control debugging?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  RUNTIME_FUNCTIONS: {C-ABI functions with signatures}
  CODEGEN_PATTERNS: {how LLVM IR is generated}
  ARC_INTERACTION: {optimizer analysis and rewrites}
  EVAL_LLVM_DIVERGENCE: {known differences}
  DEBUG_TOOLS: {relevant diagnostic scripts/env vars}
  UNCLEAR: {anything ambiguous}
  EXISTING_BUGS: {bugs found while reading}
```

### Step 4: Pass 2 — Deep Read (sequential, focused)

**After Pass 1 agents complete**, identify the **10-15 most critical files** from their findings. These are the files where the plan's core logic lives — not periphery.

**You (the main agent) or a single focused agent MUST now read these files thoroughly.** Not scan for signatures — read the actual logic. Understand:

1. **Invariants**: What properties does this code maintain? What `debug_assert!`s exist? What would break if those invariants were violated?
2. **Control flow**: How does execution actually flow through this code? What are the error paths? What are the edge cases?
3. **State mutations**: What state changes? Where? In what order? What are the pre/post conditions?
4. **Why it works this way**: Look for comments explaining design decisions. Look at git blame for recent changes. Understand the *reasoning*, not just the *structure*.
5. **What would break**: If you changed X, what else would need to change? What tests would fail? What invariants would be violated?

**Output**: For each critical file, write a paragraph (not a list) explaining how the code works, what invariants it maintains, and what would break if changed. This understanding is what grounds the plan.

**This step cannot be parallelized.** Each file read may inform what to look for in the next file. If reading file A reveals that it delegates to file B in a non-obvious way, read file B next.

### Step 5: Pass 3 — Pattern Study (single focused agent)

Launch **one agent** to trace 2-3 analogous features end-to-end through the compiler pipeline. These are features that already exist and follow the same structural pattern that the new plan will need.

```
You are studying implementation patterns in the Ori compiler. Your job is to trace analogous features end-to-end to discover the exact implementation pattern that {topic/scope} should follow.

Read CLAUDE.md first.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify 2-3 features ALREADY IMPLEMENTED in the compiler that are structurally similar to {topic}. Examples:
   - If adding a new collection type: trace how Map or Set was implemented
   - If adding a new trait: trace how Comparable or Hashable was implemented
   - If adding a new expression form: trace how match or for-yield was implemented
   - If adding codegen support: trace how an existing feature flows through ori_llvm

2. For EACH analogous feature, trace the COMPLETE implementation through every compiler phase:
   a. Lexer: What tokens? (crates/$1/src/)
   b. Parser: What AST nodes? (crates/$1/src/)
   c. IR: What IR representation? (crates/$1/src/)
   d. Type checker: What type rules? (crates/$1/src/)
   e. Registry: What method/type registrations? (crates/$1/src/)
   f. Evaluator: What evaluation logic? (crates/$1/src/)
   g. ARC pipeline: What memory analysis? (crates/$1/src/)
   h. LLVM codegen: What IR generation? (crates/$1/src/)
   i. Runtime: What C-ABI support? (crates/$1/src/)
   j. Stdlib: What library support? ()
   k. Tests: What test files and patterns? (tests/spec/, */tests.rs)

3. For each phase, READ THE ACTUAL CODE. Report:
   - Exact file path and function/type names
   - How data enters and leaves that phase
   - What registration/sync points were needed
   - What the implementation pattern is (not just "it exists" but "here's how it works")

4. Synthesize the pattern:
   - What is the exact sequence of files to create/modify?
   - What is the exact sequence of types/enums/match-arms to add?
   - What is the order of operations? (What must come first?)
   - Where did the analogous feature deviate from the expected pattern, and why?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each analogous feature:
  FEATURE: {name}
  PIPELINE TRACE:
    LEXER: {file, tokens, how it works}
    PARSER: {file, AST nodes, how it works}
    IR: {file, IR types, how it works}
    TYPECK: {file, type rules, how it works}
    REGISTRY: {file, registrations, how it works}
    EVAL: {file, eval logic, how it works}
    ARC: {file, analysis, how it works}
    LLVM: {file, codegen, how it works}
    RUNTIME: {file, C-ABI, how it works}
    STDLIB: {file, library support, how it works}
    TESTS: {files, patterns, coverage}
  SYNC_POINTS: {all registration points that had to stay in sync}
  ORDER_OF_OPERATIONS: {what was built first, second, third}
  DEVIATIONS: {where this feature broke the expected pattern}

Then:
  RECOMMENDED_PATTERN: {the pattern the new plan should follow}
  RECOMMENDED_ORDER: {the order in which phases should be implemented}
  PATTERN_RISKS: {where the new feature might need to deviate from the pattern}
```

### Step 6: Pass 4 — Prior Art Study (single focused agent)

Launch **one agent** to study reference compilers for the specific design decisions this plan will face. Not "how does Rust work generally" — "how does Rust solve *this specific problem*."

```
You are studying prior art in reference compiler implementations. Your job is to find how other compilers handle the specific design decisions that {topic/scope} will face.

Read CLAUDE.md first for reference repo locations.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the 2-4 specific DESIGN DECISIONS this plan will need to make. Examples:
   - "Should X use static dispatch or dynamic dispatch?"
   - "Should X be represented in the IR or desugared earlier?"
   - "How should X interact with the ARC pipeline?"
   - "What error messages should X produce?"

2. For EACH design decision, check the reference repos at ~/projects/reference_repos/lang_repos/:
   - Rust, Swift, Koka, Lean4 for ARC/memory topics
   - Gleam, Elm, Roc for type system topics
   - Go, Zig, TypeScript for general patterns

3. For each reference implementation you find:
   - Read the ACTUAL CODE (not just file names)
   - Understand their design choice and WHY they made it
   - Note the trade-offs they accepted
   - Note any bugs or limitations in their approach

4. Synthesize design recommendations:
   - For each design decision, recommend an approach with evidence
   - Cite specific files and patterns from reference implementations
   - Explain which reference implementation's approach best fits Ori's constraints

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each design decision:
  DECISION: {what needs to be decided}
  REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
    {Language}: {file path} — {their approach and why}
    {Language}: {file path} — {their approach and why}
  RECOMMENDATION: {what Ori should do}
  EVIDENCE: {why, citing specific reference impl trade-offs}
  RISKS: {what could go wrong with this approach}
```

**Note**: Passes 3 and 4 CAN run in parallel with each other (they are independent), but both MUST wait for Passes 1-2 to complete (they depend on knowing what files and code are relevant).

---

### Step 6B: Third-Party Architectural Consultation

**SEQUENTIAL & FOREGROUND — MANDATORY.** This `/tp-help` call MUST run in the foreground (NOT `run_in_background`). You MUST wait for it to complete and read its output before proceeding to Phase 3. Do NOT launch this in parallel with any other agent or skill invocation.

**After ALL research passes complete**, call `/tp-help` to get a second opinion on the architectural direction before committing to it. This is the highest-leverage consultation point — all research is in, but no architecture is locked.

Build a `/tp-help` prompt that includes:
- The plan's mission/goal
- A condensed summary of key research findings (critical files, sync points, design decisions, analogous patterns, existing bugs)
- The 2-3 most important architectural decisions you're about to make
- Your preliminary architectural direction

Ask Codex specifically:
- "Do you see any architectural risks I'm missing?"
- "Is this the right decomposition for this problem?"
- "Are there better patterns from the reference compilers for this specific case?"

Evaluate Codex's response against your research — you have deeper codebase context, so filter accordingly. Incorporate useful insights into the architecture design.

---

## Phase 3: Architecture Design (REQUIRED BEFORE SECTION WRITING)

This phase synthesizes all research into a cohesive architecture. **No sections are written until the architecture is designed and the user approves it.**

### Step 7: Synthesize Research into Architecture

After ALL research passes complete, synthesize findings into a structured architecture. Compile:

1. **Complete file inventory** — every file that will be touched, with line counts and current state
2. **Deep understanding summary** — for each critical file, how the code works, what invariants it maintains, what would break (from Pass 2)
3. **Implementation pattern** — the exact pattern that analogous features follow, and how this plan should follow it (from Pass 3)
4. **Design decisions** — for each decision, the recommended approach with evidence from prior art (from Pass 4)
5. **All sync points** — every enum, match, registry that must be updated together
6. **Test strategy** — existing coverage AND planned test requirements per section: what tests exist (from Pass 1-2), what matrix dimensions (types x patterns) each section needs, where semantic pin tests are needed
7. **All unclear items** — things the research couldn't determine
8. **All existing bugs found** — bugs discovered during research (these go into the plan)
9. **Hygiene pre-scan** — files that need splitting or cleanup
10. **Dependency chain** — what must be built first, what gates what, what can be parallelized

### Step 8: Write `00-overview.md` FIRST

The overview is the **load-bearing design document**. It is NOT boilerplate filled in after sections are written — it is the architectural blueprint that DRIVES section content.

Write `00-overview.md` following the template in `.claude/skills/create-plan/plan-schema.md`, grounding every element in research:

- **Mission**: Based on the actual problem discovered during research — what exists, what's broken, what's missing
- **Mission Success Criteria**: Concrete, testable conditions that prove the mission is complete — derived from the approved mission statement (Step 1E). Every criterion must be traceable to at least one section. A criterion with no section delivering it is a plan gap.
- **Architecture diagram**: Based on the actual data flow map from Pass 2's deep read — show how data enters, transforms, and exits
- **Design principles**: Based on patterns observed in analogous features (Pass 3) and prior art (Pass 4) — cite the specific evidence
- **Section dependency graph**: Based on actual crate dependencies and sync points found in Pass 1 — show which sections gate others
- **Implementation sequence**: Based on the analogous feature pattern from Pass 3 — follow the same order that worked before
- **Design decisions**: Include the key design decisions from Pass 4 with recommended approaches and evidence
- **Known bugs**: Include ALL bugs found during research passes
- **Metrics**: Use actual line counts from the hygiene pre-scan

**Also create `index.md`** with keyword clusters using REAL keywords from the research (actual type names, function names, file names — not placeholders).

### Step 8B: Architecture Sanity Check via /tp-help

**SEQUENTIAL & FOREGROUND — MANDATORY.** This `/tp-help` call MUST run in the foreground (NOT `run_in_background`). You MUST wait for it to complete and read its output before proceeding to Step 9. Do NOT launch this in parallel with any other agent or skill invocation.

**Before presenting to the user**, call `/tp-help` to sanity-check the written overview architecture. This catches issues before the user sees them.

Build a `/tp-help` prompt that includes:
- The content of `00-overview.md` (or a focused summary of: mission, dependency graph, implementation sequence, key design decisions)
- The proposed section list with goals and ordering

Ask Codex specifically:
- "Does this section decomposition and ordering make sense?"
- "Are there dependency ordering issues I'm missing?"
- "Would you structure this differently?"

Incorporate feedback into `00-overview.md` before presenting to the user. If Codex flags a fundamental issue, address it now — don't pass known problems to the user review.

### Step 9: User Review of Architecture (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)

**You MUST use `AskUserQuestion` here.** Present the architecture and get explicit buy-in before writing sections.

Present:
1. **The architecture**: Summarize the design from `00-overview.md` — mission, data flow, key design decisions
2. **The proposed sections**: List each section with its goal, what files it touches, and what it depends on. Explain WHY these sections and WHY this order.
3. **Design decisions**: For each key design decision, present the recommended approach with evidence. Ask if the user agrees or wants a different approach.
4. **Analogous pattern**: "Feature X follows this pattern: {pattern}. This plan will follow the same pattern. Does this align with your vision?"
5. **Resolve unclear items**: For every `UNCLEAR` item from research, ask the user.
6. **Report existing bugs**: "During research, I found these existing issues: {list}. Per zero-deferral, these will be included in the plan."
7. **Scope adjustments**: If research revealed the scope is larger or smaller than expected, propose adjustments with rationale.

**Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 until the user responds and approves the architecture.** If they redirect or adjust scope, update the overview and re-present. If they change design decisions, update accordingly. The architecture must be agreed upon before sections are detailed.

---

## Phase 4: Sequential Section Writing (MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL — NO PARALLELISM)

**CRITICAL RULE: Write sections ONE AT A TIME, IN ORDER.** Do NOT launch parallel agents to write sections. Each section depends on decisions and details from prior sections. Section N is not written until Section N-1 is complete.

### Step 10: Create Directory Structure

**Plan root**: Use `$ORI_PLAN_ROOT` if set, otherwise `plans`. Check with `echo ${ORI_PLAN_ROOT:-plans}` — this is the base directory for the plan.

Create the plan directory under the plan root:

```
{plan_root}/{name}/
├── index.md           # Already created in Step 8
├── 00-overview.md     # Already created in Step 8
├── section-01-*.md    # Written sequentially starting here
├── section-02-*.md    # Written after section-01 is complete
└── section-NN-*.md    # Written after all prior sections are complete
```

Where `{plan_root}` is `${ORI_PLAN_ROOT:-plans}`. When `ORI_PLAN_ROOT` is not set, this resolves to the standard `plans/{name}/`.

### Step 11: Write Sections Sequentially

For each section, in order from 01 to N:

**Before writing the section**, re-read:
- The `00-overview.md` architecture (to stay aligned with the design)
- ALL previously written sections (to reference their decisions and avoid contradictions)
- The relevant research findings for this section's scope

**Write the section** following the template in `.claude/skills/create-plan/plan-schema.md`. Every section must be grounded:

- **File paths**: Use EXACT paths from research (verified to exist)
- **Type signatures**: Use EXACT signatures from research (copy from source)
- **Function references**: Use EXACT function names from research
- **Registration sync points**: List ALL sync points from research for any new enum variant/type/entry
- **Analogous pattern**: Reference the analogous feature's implementation pattern — "Follow the same pattern as {feature} in {files}"
- **Code examples**: Show target implementation based on actual code patterns found during research, not invented patterns
- **Test strategy**: Every section that modifies code MUST include matrix testing and pinning requirements per CLAUDE.md — this is not deferred to implementation or review:
  - **Matrix dimensions**: Identify ALL types and ALL control-flow patterns that flow through the changed code path. The plan must name these explicitly (e.g., "test with str, [int], Option<str>, closures, structs, maps" and "test full iteration, break, yield, guard, nested, two-call"). Missing cells are future regressions.
  - **Semantic pin**: At least one test per behavioral change that ONLY passes with the new semantics — a permanent regression guard. The plan must describe what the pin tests.
  - **TDD ordering**: "Write failing test matrix BEFORE implementation" as the section's FIRST checklist item; "Verify all tests pass in debug and release" as the LAST item.
  - **Test types**: Specify which test categories (Rust unit tests in sibling `tests.rs`, Ori spec tests in `tests/spec/`, AOT tests in `ori_llvm/tests/aot/`, Valgrind tests in `tests/valgrind/`).
  - A section without explicit matrix dimensions and semantic pin requirements is NOT executable.
- **Dependencies on prior sections**: Explicitly reference what earlier sections provide. "This section uses the {type} defined in Section {N} ({file path})."
- **What this section provides to later sections**: State what downstream sections will depend on. "Section {M} will use the {API/type/pattern} established here."

- **Success criteria**: Every section MUST have detailed success criteria — concrete, testable conditions that prove the section's work is done. Not "implement X" but "X produces Y when Z is run." Each criterion must connect upward to at least one mission success criterion in `00-overview.md`. A section without success criteria is not executable.
- **Rules woven in**: Every section must embed the CLAUDE.md and `.claude/rules/*.md` rules that apply to its work — not as a "rules" appendix, but woven organically into checklist items, constraints, and callouts. Read CLAUDE.md and the relevant rule files (`.claude/rules/tests.md` for test sections, `.claude/rules/compiler.md` for compiler changes, `.claude/rules/registry.md` for registry work, `.claude/rules/arc.md` for ARC work, etc.) and embed the applicable constraints directly into the section's tasks. For example: if a section adds an enum variant, the checklist item should say "Add `FooVariant` to `BarEnum` in `file.rs` — update ALL match arms (see `other_file.rs:123`, `third_file.rs:456`)" rather than "Add variant (remember to check sync points)." The plan is a self-contained execution document — the implementer should not need to consult external rule files to know what a section requires.

**Frontmatter includes:**
- Section ID, title, status: not-started, goal, `success_criteria` list
- `reviewed` field (see rules below)
- `inspired_by` with actual reference implementations found
- `depends_on` based on actual crate dependency chain AND section content dependencies
- `third_party_review: { status: none, updated: null }`
- `## {NN}.R Third Party Review Findings` block (empty, with `- None.`) before the completion checklist
- **Per-subsection close-out blocks** — EVERY subsection ({NN}.1, {NN}.2, ...) MUST end with a "Subsection close-out" block containing the per-subsection `/improve-tooling` retrospective BEFORE the `---` separator. This is the PRIMARY tooling growth mechanism — pain memory decays within hours, so the look-back must fire while the subsection's debugging journey is still hot, not deferred to section close. Use the canonical form from `plan-schema.md` (subsection {NN}.1 example). Plans that omit per-subsection close-outs will fail `/continue-roadmap` validation.
- Completion checklist at the end — MUST include `/tpr-review`, `/impl-hygiene-review`, AND `/improve-tooling` **section-close sweep** as final gates, in that order: TPR clean → hygiene clean → tooling sweep. The sweep is a SAFETY NET that (a) verifies every subsection's per-subsection retrospective actually ran, and (b) adds only NEW items from cross-subsection patterns invisible at per-item scope. The bulk of tooling growth must already be captured in per-subsection close-outs by the time the sweep runs. The sweep is mandatory at every section close (even when nothing felt painful), but it should produce few or zero new findings when per-subsection captures are thorough — that is the expected outcome. See `plan-schema.md` for the exact wording, and `.claude/skills/improve-tooling/SKILL.md` "Retrospective Mode" for both granularities.

**`reviewed` field rules:**
- **ALL sections**: `reviewed: false` at creation — plans are written against research findings, not validated against implementation reality. `/continue-roadmap`'s pre-implementation gate (Step 1.7) will trigger a single-section `/review-plan` before work begins on each section, flipping it to `reviewed: true` after validation.

**After writing each section**, briefly verify:
- File paths referenced in this section exist
- Type/function names referenced exist
- References to prior sections are accurate (re-read the referenced section if needed)
- No contradictions with prior sections

Then proceed to the next section.

### Step 12: Update Overview and Index

After all sections are written:
- Update `00-overview.md` with the final section list, dependency graph, and any adjustments that emerged during sequential writing
- Update `index.md` with complete keyword clusters for all sections — using actual type names, function names, and file names from the written sections

---

## Phase 5: Cohesion Review & Finalization

### Step 13: Cohesion Check (NEW — before /review-plan)

Launch **one agent** to read the ENTIRE plan front-to-back and check for internal coherence:

```
You are reviewing a newly created plan for internal coherence. Read EVERY file in the plan directory: {plan_dir}/

Check for:
1. CONTRADICTIONS: Does Section X say one thing and Section Y say another? (e.g., Section 2 says "add variant Foo to enum Bar" but Section 5 says "add variant Baz to enum Bar" for the same purpose)
2. GAPS: Is there work that falls between sections? (e.g., Section 2 produces a type that Section 4 consumes, but no section handles the transformation between them)
3. REDUNDANCY: Do multiple sections do the same work? (e.g., both Section 3 and Section 5 add the same match arm)
4. BROKEN REFERENCES: Does Section X reference a type/file/function from Section Y that Section Y doesn't actually define?
5. ORDERING ISSUES: Does Section X depend on work described in Section Y, but X comes before Y?
6. SYNC POINT COMPLETENESS: Are ALL sync points (enum variants, match arms, registry entries) accounted for across all sections? Is any sync point mentioned in one section but forgotten in its counterpart section?
7. OVERVIEW ALIGNMENT: Does the overview's architecture diagram, dependency graph, and implementation sequence still match what the sections actually describe?
8. SUCCESS CRITERIA COVERAGE: Does every mission success criterion in 00-overview.md trace to at least one section that delivers it? Does every section have its own success criteria? Does each section criterion connect upward to at least one mission criterion? A mission criterion with no section delivering it is a plan gap. A section without success criteria is not executable.

For each issue found, report:
  ISSUE TYPE: {contradiction/gap/redundancy/broken-ref/ordering/sync-gap/overview-drift}
  SECTIONS: {which sections are involved}
  DETAILS: {what the issue is}
  FIX: {how to resolve it}
```

Fix all issues found by the cohesion check before proceeding.

### Step 14: Self-Check Before Review

Do a quick self-audit:

1. **Every file path in the plan** — verify it exists in the codebase (use Glob)
2. **Every function/type reference** — verify it exists (use Grep)
3. **Every registration sync point** — verify the list is complete
4. **No placeholder content** — no "TBD", no "placeholder keywords", no "to be determined"
5. **No assumptions** — every technical claim traces to research
6. **No contradictions** — cohesion check passed clean
7. **Test strategy per section** — every code-modifying section has: explicit matrix dimensions (types x patterns), semantic pin requirements, TDD ordering (failing tests first, debug+release last)
8. **Success criteria hierarchy** — `00-overview.md` has mission success criteria; every section has its own success criteria in both frontmatter and body; every mission criterion maps to at least one section; every section criterion maps upward to at least one mission criterion

Fix any issues found.

### Step 15: Report Progress

Show the user:
- Files created (with paths)
- Brief summary of what each section covers
- Any issues found and fixed during cohesion/self-check
- Note: "Running /review-plan for formal review..."

### Step 16: Run /review-plan (MANDATORY — USE THE ACTUAL SKILL)

**SEQUENTIAL & FOREGROUND — MANDATORY.** The `/review-plan` skill internally calls `/tp-help` multiple times (before agents and between agents). All of those internal calls are sequential and foreground — do NOT attempt to optimize by running them in parallel or background. Wait for `/review-plan` to complete fully before proceeding.

**CRITICAL: Run the actual `/review-plan` skill using the Skill tool.** Do NOT reimplement the review logic. Do NOT spawn your own review agents. Use the Skill tool to invoke `/review-plan` with the plan directory path as the argument.

```
Skill: review-plan
Args: {plan_root}/{name}/
```

This runs the formal review pipeline as defined in the `/review-plan` skill. It will edit the plan files directly to fix any issues.

### Step 17: Post-Review Summary

After `/review-plan` completes, report to the user:
- The review verdict
- What the review changed
- Any remaining concerns that need human judgement

### Step 18: Reroute Lifecycle Setup — MANDATORY

**This step is MANDATORY for every plan creation and is NEVER silently skipped.** The reroute system controls which plan `/continue-roadmap` jumps to first, so getting the queue right is load-bearing for every future session. The only valid skip condition is enumerated below — and even then, the skip must be acknowledged out loud, not silent.

#### When this step runs

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **New plan** (just created in this session) | ALWAYS run — ask the reroute question |
| **Existing plan, no reroute frontmatter present** | ALWAYS run — ask the reroute question |
| **Existing plan, reroute frontmatter already populated** | Run, but offer to keep the existing settings as the default option |
| **Operating on `plans/roadmap/` directly** | SKIP — the main roadmap is never a reroute by definition. Acknowledge the skip out loud: "Skipping reroute setup — operating on the main roadmap directly." |

There is no other skip condition. If you find yourself reaching the end of the skill without having run this step, that is a bug — go back and run it.

#### Sub-step 18.1: Read the current reroute landscape

Run the scanner to capture the current state of the queue:

```bash
.claude/skills/continue-roadmap/roadmap-scan.sh plans/roadmap 2>&1 | sed -n '/=== REROUTES ===/,/^$/p'
```

This emits the REROUTES block — every active and queued reroute, sorted by order, with their current order values. Capture this output. You will refer back to it when computing shifts and presenting the before/after diff.

#### Sub-step 18.2: Ask the reroute question

Use `AskUserQuestion` with FOUR options:

1. **Active (highest priority — top of queue)** — `status: active`, `order: 1`. All existing active reroutes shift down by 1.
2. **Active (specific position)** — `status: active`, `order: N` chosen interactively. All existing reroutes with `order >= N` shift down by 1.
3. **Queued (joins the queue, will be promoted later)** — `status: queued`, `order` set to the next free number after the highest queued order (or 1 + highest active order if no queueds exist).
4. **Not a reroute** — no reroute frontmatter added. The plan is parallel to the main roadmap but does not block it. Confirm by asking the user to also choose `parallel: true | false` (parallels are tracked in the scanner; non-parallel non-reroute plans are invisible to `/continue-roadmap`).

When presenting the question, include the current REROUTES block from sub-step 18.1 in the question text so the user can see the queue they're inserting into.

#### Sub-step 18.3: Compute the order shifts

The `order` field uses a **single global namespace**: every reroute (active or queued, in any plan directory) has a unique `order` value. The shift algorithm depends on the user's answer:

| User chose | Algorithm |
|---|---|
| **Active, top** | New plan gets `order: 1`. Every existing reroute (active and queued) with `order >= 1` shifts to `order + 1`. (i.e., everything shifts down by one.) |
| **Active, position N** | New plan gets `order: N`. Every existing reroute with `order >= N` shifts to `order + 1`. Reroutes with `order < N` are unchanged. |
| **Queued** | New plan gets `order = max(all existing reroute orders) + 1`. No existing plans shift. |
| **Not a reroute** | No order assigned. No shifts. |

**Edge cases to handle explicitly**:
- A plan with no `order:` field defaults to `999`. When shifting, treat `999` as a sentinel ("no specific order, parked at the bottom") — do NOT shift `999` plans. But if the user picks a high N that collides with `999`, set the colliding plan's order to a real value before shifting.
- Two existing plans with the same `order` value (collision from a prior bug or manual edit): flag this to the user before shifting. The user must resolve the collision first, OR you must offer to resolve it as part of this step (assign the lower-numbered plan to the lower order, the higher-numbered plan to the next free slot).
- Active and queued plans share the same namespace, so a queued plan at `order: 6` and an active plan at `order: 6` is a collision even though they're filtered separately by the scanner. Resolve.

#### Sub-step 18.4: Present the before/after diff

Before writing any files, show the user a side-by-side preview:

```
Current reroute queue:
  1. [active]  Plan A
  2. [active]  Plan B
  3. [queued]  Plan C
  4. [queued]  Plan D

After your change ({choice}):
  1. [active]  NEW PLAN  ← inserted
  2. [active]  Plan A    ← was 1
  3. [active]  Plan B    ← was 2
  4. [queued]  Plan C    ← was 3
  5. [queued]  Plan D    ← was 4

Files that will be modified:
  - plans/<new-plan>/index.md       — add reroute frontmatter
  - plans/<new-plan>/00-overview.md — set status to match
  - plans/plan-a/index.md            — order 1 → 2
  - plans/plan-b/index.md            — order 2 → 3
  - plans/plan-c/index.md            — order 3 → 4
  - plans/plan-d/index.md            — order 4 → 5
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask "Apply these changes?" with options "Apply", "Adjust position", "Cancel reroute setup".

#### Sub-step 18.5: Apply the changes

Once the user confirms, update **every** file in the modification list. The full sync surface for any reroute change is:

| File | What to change |
|---|---|
| `plans/<new-plan>/index.md` | Add `reroute: true`, `name`, `full_name`, `status`, `order` to frontmatter |
| `plans/<new-plan>/00-overview.md` | Set `status:` field to match (`active`, `queued`, or unset for non-reroute) |
| `plans/<shifted-plan>/index.md` (each) | Update `order:` value to the shifted number |

**Do NOT update**:
- The Quick Reference / Estimated Effort tables in `00-overview.md` — those track section status, not plan-level reroute meta. Section status is independent of reroute order.
- `plans/roadmap/00-overview.md` — the main roadmap doesn't track per-reroute orders; the scanner discovers them dynamically.
- Section files inside any plan — section content is independent of reroute order.

#### Sub-step 18.6: Verify the result

After applying, re-run the scanner to confirm the queue is well-ordered:

```bash
.claude/skills/continue-roadmap/roadmap-scan.sh plans/roadmap 2>&1 | sed -n '/=== REROUTES ===/,/^$/p'
```

The output should show:
- The new plan in its expected position
- All shifted plans with their new orders
- No duplicate orders within the active set
- No duplicate orders within the queued set
- No active-vs-queued collisions on the same order

If verification fails, STOP and diagnose — do not move on with a corrupted queue. Common causes: a plan's index.md was modified by another process during the apply step (conflict), or an order value was missed during the shift loop. Re-read the scanner output, find the discrepancy, fix it, re-verify.

#### Sub-step 18.7: Report

Report the final state to the user in a single paragraph:
- What `status` and `order` the new plan got
- How many existing plans were shifted (and their new orders)
- The verification scanner output snippet
- A reminder that `/continue-roadmap` will now pick up the new plan first (if active at order: 1) or queue it for promotion (if queued)

### Step 19: Cross-Plan Review Invalidation (MANDATORY)

A new cross-cutting plan can invalidate `reviewed: true` sections in other plans. If this plan touches files, types, or subsystems that other plan sections reference, those reviews are stale — they were validated against a codebase state that this plan will change.

**Why this matters:** `reviewed: true` means "validated against the current codebase." A new plan that modifies overlapping files/types changes the codebase those reviews were validated against. Without invalidation, `/continue-roadmap` would start implementing a section whose review is stale, potentially building on wrong assumptions.

#### Sub-step 19.1: Run invalidation detection

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/plan-audit/plan-invalidate.py {plan_root}/{name}/ --json
```

Read the JSON output. This scans ALL active plans (not completed, not the plan itself) for sections with `reviewed: true` whose file/symbol scope overlaps with the new plan's scope.

#### Sub-step 19.2: Present findings to user

If overlapping sections are found, present them to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> **Cross-plan review invalidation detected.**
>
> This plan's scope overlaps with **N reviewed sections** across **M other plans**. These sections have `reviewed: true` but their reviews may be stale because this plan modifies files/types they reference.
>
> **High-impact overlaps** (weight ≥ 4):
> - `plans/foo/section-03.md` — overlapping files: `crates/$1/src/...` (weight: 8)
> - `plans/bar/section-01.md` — overlapping symbols: `EnumRepr`, `IrBuilder` (weight: 5)
>
> **Lower-impact overlaps** (weight 2-3):
> - `plans/baz/section-02.md` — 1 shared file (weight: 2)
>
> **Recommendation:** Flip `reviewed: true` → `reviewed: false` on affected sections so `/continue-roadmap` will re-review them before implementation begins.
>
> Options:
> 1. **Apply all** — invalidate all N sections
> 2. **Apply high-impact only** — invalidate only weight ≥ 4 sections
> 3. **Skip** — leave reviews as-is (not recommended)

#### Sub-step 19.3: Apply invalidation

If the user approves (option 1 or 2), apply the invalidation:

```bash
# For "apply all":
python3 .claude/skills/plan-audit/plan-invalidate.py {plan_root}/{name}/ --apply

# For "high-impact only":
python3 .claude/skills/plan-audit/plan-invalidate.py {plan_root}/{name}/ --apply --min-weight 4
```

Report what was changed:
- How many sections were flipped to `reviewed: false`
- Which plans were affected
- Reminder: `/continue-roadmap` will re-review these sections when they come up for implementation

#### Sub-step 19.4: No overlaps found

If the detection returns zero stale sections, report: "No cross-plan review invalidation needed — no other plan sections' reviewed scopes overlap with this plan."

## Example

**Input:** `/create-plan error-recovery "Improve compiler error messages and recovery"`

**Phase 1**: Read CLAUDE.md. Ask user about scope ("Which crates? Which error types?").

**Phase 2**:
- *Pass 1*: Launch 2 parallel agents — (1) survey `ori_diagnostic`, `ori_types` errors, `ori_parse` recovery, all error-related files; (2) audit tests, spec error codes, hygiene state.
- *Pass 2*: Deep-read the 12 most critical files. Understand how `DiagnosticQueue` dedup works, how `ErrorGuaranteed` propagates, how recovery tokens are chosen.
- *Pass 3*: Trace how `E2029` (Hashable-without-Eq) was implemented end-to-end — from type checker detection through diagnostic emission to test coverage. Trace how `E0860` (break-value-in-while) was implemented. Document the exact pattern.
- *Pass 4*: Study Elm's error diffing (`Reporting/Error/Type.hs`), Roc's `to_diff` pattern, Rust's `DiagnosticBuilder` chain pattern. Recommend approaches for Ori.

**Phase 3**: Design architecture. Write `00-overview.md` with data flow, design decisions (Elm-style diffing vs Rust-style chaining), dependency graph. Present to user: "Found 117 error codes, 64 with docs. The E2029 pattern shows {pattern}. Propose these sections in this order: {list}. The key design decision is {X} — I recommend {Y} because {evidence}."

**Phase 4**: After user approves architecture, write sections sequentially:
- Section 01 (error types) → read it → write Section 02 (recovery strategies, building on 01's types) → read both → write Section 03 (user-facing messages, building on 01+02).

**Phase 5**: Cohesion check → self-check → report → run `/review-plan plans/error-recovery/`.

**Creates:**
```
plans/error-recovery/
├── index.md
├── 00-overview.md
├── section-01-error-types.md
├── section-02-recovery-strategies.md
└── section-03-user-facing-messages.md
```

## Anti-Deferral Rule for Plan Items

**Every checklist item in a plan must be implementable by the agent executing that section.** When writing plan items:

- Do NOT use soft language that invites skipping: "bonus", "future", "lower priority", "nice to have", "if time permits", "stretch goal".
- Do NOT label items "requires architectural change" — architectural changes are implementation tasks, not deferrals. If a 30-line change across 3 files is needed, describe the change and make it a checkbox.
- Do NOT create items that are descriptions of work rather than work itself. "Investigate whether X" is acceptable; "Document the approach for Y" when Y can be implemented is not.
- If an item genuinely cannot be done within the section (blocked by an unimplemented language feature, needs user decision), use `<!-- blocked-by:X -->` with a concrete blocker reference — not vague language.
- Every item must pass this test: "Can the implementing agent, with access to the codebase, complete this item in a single session?" If no, break it into items that can.

## Matrix Testing & Semantic Pinning Rule

**Every section that modifies compiler code must specify its test strategy at plan creation time.** This is not deferred to implementation or to `/review-plan` — the plan itself must describe:

1. **Matrix dimensions**: The types and control-flow patterns that flow through the section's code paths. These are the rows and columns of the test matrix. Name them explicitly — "str, [int], Option<str>, closures, structs, maps, sets" for type dimension; "full iteration, break, yield, guard, nested, two-call" for pattern dimension. Missing cells are future regressions.
2. **Semantic pin**: At least one test per behavioral change that ONLY passes with the new semantics. Without a pin, a regression can silently revert the fix. The plan must describe what each pin tests.
3. **TDD discipline**: The section's first checklist item writes the failing test matrix. The section's last checklist item verifies debug + release. Tests frame the implementation, not follow it.
4. **Cross-section coverage**: If a fix in Section N touches code owned by Section M, the test matrix must cover Section M's types and patterns too. Plan boundaries = test boundaries.

A section without these is not executable per CLAUDE.md. The `/review-plan` skill (Agent 4) enforces this during review — but catching it at creation time avoids the review rejection cycle.

## Zero Assumptions Rule

**ABSOLUTE — NO EXCEPTIONS.** Every technical claim in the plan must be grounded to something found during research:

- **File paths**: Must exist in the codebase (verified by Glob/Read)
- **Type/function signatures**: Must match actual source (verified by reading the file)
- **Behavior descriptions**: Must match actual code behavior (verified by reading the implementation)
- **Registration sync points**: Must be the complete list (verified by Grep for all match arms / enum variants)
- **Patterns to follow**: Must reference actual analogous implementations (verified by reading them)

If you cannot verify a claim, it MUST be flagged as `<!-- UNVERIFIED: {reason} -->` and reported to the user in Step 9. Unverified claims are not acceptable in the final plan — they must be resolved before Phase 4 or removed.

## Reviewed Field Semantics

The `reviewed: true/false` field in section frontmatter is a **pre-implementation gate** — it tracks whether a section has been validated against the current codebase right before you start implementing it.

**Why this exists:** Plans are written with assumptions about how the code works. But as you implement Section 01, reality changes — deviations, discoveries, refactors, bug fixes. A section written before prior sections were implemented may reference stale file paths, wrong function signatures, or invalid approaches. `reviewed: false` means "not yet validated against implementation reality."

**Rules:**
- **ALL sections** are `reviewed: false` at creation — plans are written against research, not validated implementation reality.
- **Single-section review** (`/review-plan plans/foo/section-03.md`): This is the pre-implementation gate. After confirming accuracy, flip to `reviewed: true`.
- **Whole-plan review** (`/review-plan plans/foo/`): Fixes issues, improves quality, but does NOT change `reviewed` values. You're improving the plan holistically, not gating specific sections.
- **`/continue-roadmap`** starting a `reviewed: false` section: triggers a single-section review first, which flips to `true` after validation.

## After Creation

Remind the user to:
1. Fill in any remaining section details with specific tasks
2. Update `00-overview.md` with dependencies and success criteria if not already complete
3. **If performance-sensitive** (lexer, parser, typeck, eval, codegen): Add `/benchmark` checkpoints to relevant sections

## Performance-Sensitive Plans

For plans touching hot paths, include a "Performance Validation" section in `index.md`:

```markdown
## Performance Validation

Use `/benchmark short` after modifying hot paths.

**When to benchmark:** [list specific sections]
**Skip benchmarks for:** [list non-perf sections]
```

See `.claude/skills/create-plan/plan-schema.md` for full guidance.

## Existing Plan Mode

When the input indicates adding to an existing plan — whether the roadmap, a rerouted plan, or any other plan directory — this command operates on that plan's directory instead of creating a new one.

**Trigger examples:**
- `/create-plan add closures to roadmap` → operates on `plans/roadmap/`
- `/create-plan add "ARC IR function metadata" subsection to plans/repr-opt` → operates on `plans/repr-opt/`
- `/create-plan roadmap: pattern matching` → operates on `plans/roadmap/`

**Same rigor, different target.** Every phase applies identically — the research depth, the iterative deepening, the sequential writing, the cohesion review. The only differences are structural: you're inserting into an existing plan, not creating a fresh one.

### Subsection vs Section Granularity

When invoked from `/continue-roadmap` impediment resolution (Step 2.6), the work is typically a **subsection** added to an existing section — not a whole new section file. The granularity depends on scope:

- **Subsection** (most common for impediments): Add a `## XX.Y` block to an existing section file. Example: adding `## 03.5b ARC IR Function Metadata` to `section-03-range-analysis.md` to resolve the missing visibility/trait/closure plumbing.
- **Section**: Add a new section file when the work is large enough to warrant its own file (100+ lines of plan content, multiple subsections, distinct from existing section scope).

For subsections: update the parent section's YAML frontmatter `sections:` array to include the new subsection entry. For sections: create a new section file and update `00-overview.md` and `index.md`.

### Existing Plan Mode: How It Differs

#### Phase 1 Differences

- **Step 1**: Instead of asking for a plan name, identify:
  1. **What feature/section/subsection** to add to the plan
  2. **Where it fits** — after which existing section? What does it depend on?
  3. **What it might affect** — which existing sections reference related code?
  4. **What it unblocks** — which blocked items will this resolve? (Critical for impediment-driven additions)

- **Step 2**: In addition to the template and hygiene rules, **read the target plan**:
  - `plans/<dir>/00-overview.md` — understand the mission, architecture, dependency graph
  - `plans/<dir>/index.md` — understand the keyword structure and section numbering
  - **The section(s) most related to the new work** — understand what's already planned, what's complete, what's in progress
  - Pay attention to: section dependencies, implementation sequence, cross-section interactions

#### Phase 2 Differences

Research is identical in rigor, but adds a plan-specific dimension:

- **Pass 1**: In addition to the standard inventory, identify:
  - Which existing plan sections touch the same files/types/crates
  - Which existing sections might need updates due to the new section/subsection
  - Whether any completed sections already partially cover the new scope

- **Pass 2**: In addition to deep-reading critical files, deep-read:
  - The 2-3 existing plan sections most related to the new one
  - Any completed sections that the new work builds on (to understand what was actually implemented vs. what was planned)

#### Phase 3 Differences

- **Step 7**: Synthesis must include:
  - **Impact analysis**: How does the new section/subsection affect the existing plan? Does it change dependencies? Does it invalidate assumptions in other sections?
  - **Insertion point**: Where does it go? For subsections: which `## XX.Y` header, what ID? For sections: which section number? (May require renumbering)
  - **Dependency updates**: Which existing sections need `depends_on` updates?
  - **Unblock analysis** (for impediment-driven additions): Which `<!-- blocked: ... -->` comments will this resolve? List them explicitly.

- **Step 8**: Instead of writing a new `00-overview.md`:
  - **For subsections**: Update the parent section's YAML frontmatter `sections:` array to include the new subsection entry. Update the section body with the new `## XX.Y` block.
  - **For sections**: Create the new section file. Update `00-overview.md` — add the new section to the architecture diagram, dependency graph, implementation sequence, quick reference table, and estimated effort. Update `index.md` — add keyword clusters for the new section.
  - If the overview or index format has drifted from the current template (`.claude/skills/create-plan/plan-schema.md`), bring them up to date while you're editing them

- **Step 9**: Present to the user:
  - The proposed new section/subsection with its goals and scope
  - The impact on existing sections (what changes, what doesn't)
  - Which blocked items this will unblock (for impediment-driven additions)
  - Any existing sections that need updates and what those updates are

#### Phase 4 Differences

- **Step 11**: Write the new section(s)/subsection(s) following the same sequential discipline. If multiple are needed, write them in order.

- **After writing**: Update any existing sections that are affected:
  - Update `depends_on` in sections that now depend on the new work
  - Update cross-references in sections that reference related code
  - Update `00-overview.md` dependency graph and implementation sequence (for new sections)
  - Update `index.md` with new keywords (for new sections)
  - **Remove `<!-- blocked: ... -->` comments** from items that the new work will unblock (for impediment-driven additions)
  - If any existing section's content is now stale or contradicted by the new work, fix it. Flag the section as `reviewed: false` if you changed its assumptions.

#### Phase 5 Differences

- **Step 13**: The cohesion check reads the relevant plan sections (all sections for full plans; the parent section + neighbors for subsection additions), checking that:
  - The new work is consistent with existing sections
  - No existing section contradicts the new work
  - The dependency graph in `00-overview.md` is accurate (if modified)
  - The implementation sequence still makes sense
  - Cross-references between sections are all valid

- **Step 16**: Run `/review-plan` on the affected plan directory

- **Step 18**: Follow the full lifecycle protocol defined in the main Step 18 — the only valid skip condition is operating on `plans/roadmap/` directly (the main roadmap is never a reroute by definition). When operating on an existing plan that already has reroute frontmatter populated, run Step 18 anyway — it offers the existing settings as the default so the user can keep them with one click, but still gets the chance to reprioritize. Adding a subsection to an existing reroute is a perfectly valid trigger to reconsider that reroute's position in the queue (e.g., "this new subsection makes the plan critical — promote to order: 1").

### Existing Plan Mode: The "Leave It Better" Rule

**You MUST leave the plan in better shape than you found it.** When operating in existing plan mode:

1. **Format drift**: If the plan's existing sections don't match the current template format (`.claude/skills/create-plan/plan-schema.md`), update them to match. This includes frontmatter fields, section structure, completion checklists, and third-party review blocks.
2. **Stale content**: If you encounter stale file paths, outdated type signatures, or references to code that no longer exists, fix them.
3. **Missing cross-references**: If sections reference each other implicitly but lack explicit `depends_on` or co-implementation callouts, add them.
4. **Incomplete hygiene**: If sections lack completion checklists, exit criteria, or test strategies, add them.
5. **Overview accuracy**: The overview's architecture diagram, dependency graph, and implementation sequence must accurately reflect the current state of the plan after your changes.

This is not optional cleanup — it's a mandatory part of existing plan mode. Every touch of the plan is an opportunity to improve its coherence and accuracy.

### Existing Plan Mode: Impediment Resolution Example

**Input** (from `/continue-roadmap` Step 2.6):
`/create-plan add "ARC IR Function Metadata" subsection to plans/repr-opt`

**Phase 1**: Read CLAUDE.md. Read `plans/repr-opt/00-overview.md` and the section containing blocked items (e.g., `section-03-range-analysis.md`). Identify that §03.5 has 6 items blocked by "ARC IR lacks visibility/trait/closure metadata."

**Phase 2**:
- *Pass 1*: Survey `ArcFunction` fields in `ori_arc/src/ir/mod.rs`. Find `FunctionSig.is_public` in `ori_types`. Check `lower_to_arc()` in `oric/src/arc_lowering.rs`.
- *Pass 2*: Deep-read the lowering path. Discover `is_public` exists upstream but is dropped. `num_captures > 0` already identifies closures. Only `is_trait_method` needs inference from `impl_sigs`.

**Phase 3**: Design subsection `03.5b ARC IR Function Metadata`. Scope: add `is_public` and `is_trait_method` to `ArcFunction`, thread through lowering, use in `propagate_ranges()`. Update §03 frontmatter with new subsection entry. Present to user with list of 6 items that will be unblocked.

**Phase 4**: Write the `## 03.5b` block in `section-03-range-analysis.md`. Remove `<!-- blocked: ... -->` comments from the 6 items. Update §03 frontmatter sections array.

**Phase 5**: Cohesion check against §03 and §04 (which also consumes range data). Verify no contradictions.

### Existing Plan Mode: Roadmap Example

**Input:** `/create-plan add pattern matching exhaustiveness to roadmap`

**Phase 1**: Read CLAUDE.md. Read the entire roadmap (overview + all sections). Identify that this relates to type checker work, probably depends on existing Section 07 (type inference), and might affect Section 12 (verification).

**Phase 2**:
- *Pass 1*: Survey exhaustiveness checking code in `ori_types`, find that `ori_types/src/check/exhaustiveness.rs` exists with 340 lines. Find that Section 07 touches `ori_types/src/check/` but doesn't cover exhaustiveness.
- *Pass 2*: Deep-read `exhaustiveness.rs` and the 3 existing roadmap sections most related. Discover that Section 07's completion assumes exhaustiveness works, but the current implementation has gaps for nested patterns.
- *Pass 3*: Trace how Gleam's exhaustiveness checker works end-to-end (`compiler-core/src/exhaustiveness.rs`).
- *Pass 4*: Compare Elm's exhaustiveness approach (algebraic, provably complete) vs Rust's (witness-based).

**Phase 3**: Design the new section. Determine it should be Section 08 (after type inference, before integration). Update `00-overview.md` dependency graph. Present to user: "The new section depends on 07, and Section 12 should depend on it. Here's the impact..."

**Phase 4**: Write Section 08 sequentially. Then update Section 07 (add forward reference), Section 12 (add dependency), and `00-overview.md` (updated graph + sequence).

**Phase 5**: Cohesion check on full roadmap. Fix any format drift found in older sections. Run `/review-plan plans/roadmap/`.
