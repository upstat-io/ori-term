# Plan Schema

The single source of truth for plan structure. All plans in `plans/` and `plans/completed/` must conform to this schema. Referenced by `/create-plan` (creation) and `/continue-roadmap` (validation).

## Overview File Template (`00-overview.md`)

The overview is the master document. It answers: **what** is the goal, **why** does it matter, **how** do the pieces fit together, and **in what order** should they be built?

```markdown
---
plan: "{plan-name}"
title: "{Plan Title}: Exhaustive Implementation Plan"
status: not-started
supersedes:             # Plans this replaces (if any)
  - "plans/{old-plan}/"
references:             # Design docs, proposals, prior art
  - "plans/{related-doc}.md"
  - "docs/ori_lang/proposals/{proposal}.md"
---

# {Plan Title}: Exhaustive Implementation Plan

## Mission

{1-2 sentences. What is this plan accomplishing and why? Not "implement X" but "complete X as one cohesive system: from A through B to C." Establish scope and intent.}

## Mission Success Criteria

{The mission is complete when ALL of these are true. Each criterion must be concrete, testable, and verifiable — not "X works" but "X produces Y when Z is run." Section success criteria are the building blocks — when every section meets its own criteria, the mission criteria must follow. Every mission criterion must be traceable to at least one section that delivers it.}

- [ ] {Criterion 1 — specific, measurable, verifiable condition}
- [ ] {Criterion 2 — with command or test that proves it}
- [ ] {Criterion 3 — connects to section(s) that deliver it}
- [ ] `cargo test --all` green — no regressions
- [ ] All section success criteria met

## Architecture

\`\`\`
{ASCII diagram showing the pipeline/system being built or modified.
Show the flow of data through stages, the key types at each boundary,
and where this plan's sections fit in.}
\`\`\`

## Design Principles

{Name the core architectural principle(s) driving this plan's design.
Explain WHY these matter — cite concrete bugs or pain points that
motivated the principle. 2-3 principles max.}

\`\`\`
{Optional: show the information/data flow chain if applicable.
E.g., how each stage enriches IR for the next stage.}
\`\`\`

## Section Dependency Graph

\`\`\`
{ASCII graph showing section dependencies.
Use arrows to show what depends on what.
Note which sections are independent (parallelizable).}
\`\`\`

{Prose explanation:}
- Sections {X-Y} are independent and can be worked in any order.
- Section {Z} requires {X}. Section {W} requires all.

**Cross-section interactions (must be co-implemented):**
- **{Section A} + {Section B}**: {Why these must land together. Cite the
  specific bug or invariant that breaks if only one lands.}

## Implementation Sequence

{Resolve the dependency graph into a concrete build order. Each phase
gates the next; items within a phase can be parallelized.}

\`\`\`
Phase 0 - Prerequisites
  └─ {section}: {task description}

Phase 1 - Foundation
  └─ {section.subsection}: {task}
  └─ {section.subsection}: {task}

Phase 2 - Core implementation
  └─ {section.subsection}: {task}
  Gate: {testable condition proving this phase is complete}

Phase 3 - Integration  [CRITICAL PATH]
  └─ {section.subsection}: {task}
  Gate: {testable condition}

Phase N - Verification
  └─ {section}: {comprehensive testing}
\`\`\`

**Why this order:**
- Phase 0-1 are pure additions — no behavioral changes.
- Phase 2 must precede Phase 3 because {reason}.
- Phase 3 is the critical path because {reason}.

**Known failing tests (expected until plan completion):**

{List tests that are expected to fail and WHY. Prevents wasted effort
investigating "failures" that are symptoms of missing infrastructure.
Include root causes tied to specific phases.}

- **`test_name`** — {symptom}. Root cause: {Phase N} ({missing infrastructure}).

Do NOT attempt to fix these tests individually. They share infrastructure
dependencies that must be built bottom-up through Phases {X-Y}.

## Metrics (Current State)

{Baseline measurements before implementation begins. Establishes the
starting point so progress and regressions can be measured.}

| Crate | Production LOC | Test LOC | Total |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------|
| `{crate}` | ~{N} | ~{N} | ~{N} |
| **Total** | **~{N}** | **~{N}** | **~{N}** |

## Estimated Effort

| Section | Est. Lines | Complexity | Depends On |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
| {NN} {Title} | ~{N} | Low/Medium/High | — |
|   ↳ {NN.X} {Subsection} | ~{N} | Low | — |
| **Total new** | **~{N}** | | |
| **Total deleted** | **~{N}** | | |

## Known Bugs (Pre-existing)

{Bugs discovered during investigation that affect multiple sections.
Track root causes, fix locations, and status so they don't get lost.}

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix Location | Status |
|-----|-----------|-------------|--------|
| {Description} | {Root cause analysis} | Section {NN} | Not Started / Fixed / Guarded |

## Quick Reference

| ID | Title | File | Status |
|----|-------|------|--------|
| 01 | {Title} | `section-01-{name}.md` | Not Started |
| 02 | {Title} | `section-02-{name}.md` | Not Started |
```

---

## Index File Template (`index.md`)

The index enables keyword-based discovery across all sections. If this plan is a
**reroute** (a parallel track alongside the main roadmap), add frontmatter to make
it discoverable by the website:

```yaml
---
reroute: true
name: "{Short Name}"
full_name: "{Full Plan Name}"
status: queued
order: N
---
```

- `reroute: true` — marks this plan as a reroute (omit for non-reroute plans)
- `name` — short display name for timeline pills (e.g., "LLVM Fixes")
- `full_name` — full display name for page titles (e.g., "LLVM Codegen Fixes")
- `status` — `active | queued | resolved`
- `order` — queue priority; lower value = promoted first when active reroute completes (default 999 if omitted)
- `key` and `dir` are derived at load time from the directory name

```markdown

# Section {NN}: {Title}

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** {Expanded goal — what must be true when this section is complete.
Not "implement X" but "X works correctly under conditions A, B, C with
no regressions in Y."}

**Success Criteria:**
{Concrete, testable conditions that prove this section's work is done.
Each criterion should be independently verifiable. Together, these criteria
contribute to one or more mission success criteria in `00-overview.md`.}

- [ ] {Criterion — specific behavioral outcome with verification method}
- [ ] {Criterion — test name, command, or observable result}
- [ ] {Criterion — connects upward to mission criterion: "Satisfies mission criterion N"}

**Context:** {Why this section exists. What pain point, bug, or
architectural gap motivated it. Cite specific debugging sessions,
test failures, or design flaws. 2-4 sentences.}

**Reference implementations:**
- **{Language}** `{file path}`: {pattern name} — {what we learn from it}
- **{Language}** `{file path}`: {pattern name} — {what we learn from it}

**Depends on:** Section {NN} ({why}).

## Intelligence Reconnaissance

Queries run {YYYY-MM-DD}:

- `scripts/intel-query.sh --human <preset>` — {one-line outcome}. For compiler sections use the matching preset per `.claude/rules/intelligence.md` §Subsystem Mapping (`ori-arc`, `ori-inference`, `ori-codegen`, `ori-patterns`, `ori-diagnostics`). For non-compiler plans (meta-tooling, docs, build scripts) use `search "<key terms>"` — no preset applies.
- `scripts/intel-query.sh --human file-symbols "<path-fragment>" --repo ori` — {one-line outcome} (skip for non-Rust targets; the Ori code-symbol index is Rust-only today)
- `scripts/intel-query.sh --human callers "<symbol>" --repo ori` — {one-line outcome} (blast radius for every public API the section changes)
- `scripts/intel-query.sh --human similar "<symbol>" --repo rust,swift,koka --limit 5` — {one-line outcome} (cross-repo prior art for design decisions)

Results summary (≤500 chars) [ori]: {bounded paragraph citing blast radius, cross-repo prior art, relevant symbols. Use `[ori]` for Ori-repo claims, `[rust#N]` / `[swift#N]` / `[koka#N]` / etc. for cross-repo issue citations, and `[repo:path]` for symbol results — the same grammar used by `compose-intel-summary.md` Step D (lines 64-82) and by §07's hook injection. Maximum 5 bullets, 500 characters. If the graph is unavailable, record the unavailability state as freeform prose (e.g. `"Graph was unavailable at YYYY-MM-DD when this section was authored"`) — do NOT silently omit the block; the block MUST still exist with the date and a note about unavailability so the validator recognizes it as intentional rather than forgotten.}

See `.claude/skills/query-intel/compose-intel-summary.md` for the full query protocol (SSOT — do NOT `@`-include in plan files; plan markdown is not harness-expanded, so the include would be a dead literal).

---

<!-- == MANDATORY SECTION STRUCTURE ==
Every PLAN_SECTION file has TWO mandatory structural features that are
NOT captured by the numbered {NN}.X subsection sequence alone:

1. **Unnumbered `## Intelligence Reconnaissance` block** — placed after
   the section framing (Goal / Success Criteria / Context / Reference
   implementations / Depends on) and BEFORE `## {NN}.1`. Records the
   literal `scripts/intel-query.sh` commands the author ran, a
   ≤500-char results summary (using the same `[ori]` / `[repo#N]`
   citation grammar as `.claude/skills/query-intel/compose-intel-summary.md`
   Step D, lines 64-82), and the date. Coexists with §07's runtime hook:
   the hook omits the summary entirely when graph is unavailable; the
   plan-resident block records unavailability as freeform prose. Enforced
   by `python -m scripts.plan_corpus check` — the validator gates
   severity on the section's `status` field:
     - status: not-started → Severity.HIGH (ERROR under --strict-recon)
     - status: in-progress → Severity.MEDIUM (WARNING, no on-edit escalation)
     - status: complete    → exempt

2. **Per-subsection close-out blocks** — EVERY numbered subsection
   ({NN}.1, {NN}.2, ...) MUST end with a `**Subsection close-out**`
   block containing the per-subsection `/improve-tooling`
   retrospective and `/sync-claude` doc sync BEFORE the `---`
   separator. Pain memory decays within hours, so the look-back fires
   while the debugging journey is hot — NOT at section close.

SCOPE: The recon-block mandate applies ONLY to FileClass.PLAN_SECTION
(files matching `plans/*/section-*.md` excluding `plans/roadmap/` and
`plans/bug-tracker/`). Roadmap sections already use `## {NN}.0` for
substantive content; fix-BUG-*.md files use a separate `1. Root Cause
/ 2. TDD / ...` template that runs recon through /fix-bug Phase 1.

Plans that omit either feature will fail `/continue-roadmap`
validation. This comment is the only authoritative enumeration of
section-level structural invariants; `create-plan/SKILL.md` cites
this schema file and does NOT re-assert the invariants
(per `impl-hygiene.md` §SSOT).
-->

## {NN}.1 {Subsection Title}

**File(s):** `{file path(s) being modified}`

{Context paragraph: what this subsection does, what problem it solves,
and how it fits into the section's overall goal.}

- [ ] {Task description with enough detail to implement without ambiguity}
  \`\`\`rust
  // Code example showing the target design (types, signatures, key logic).
  // This is the SPEC — the implementation should match this.
  \`\`\`

- [ ] {Another task}
  - [ ] {Sub-task with specific file + function to modify}
  - [ ] {Sub-task}

- [ ] {Validation task — how to verify this subsection works}

- [ ] **Subsection close-out ({NN}.1)** — MANDATORY before starting {NN}.2:
  - [ ] All tasks above are `[x]` and the subsection's behavior is verified
  - [ ] Update this subsection's `status` in section frontmatter to `complete`
  - [ ] **Run `/improve-tooling` retrospectively on THIS subsection** — reflect
        on the debugging journey for {NN}.1 specifically: which `diagnostics/`
        scripts you ran, where you added `dbg!`/`tracing` calls (and what each
        was looking for), where output was hard to interpret, where test
        failures gave unhelpful messages, where you ran the same command
        sequence repeatedly. Forward-look: what tool/log/diagnostic would
        shorten the next regression in {NN}.1's code path by 10 minutes?
        Implement every accepted improvement NOW (zero deferral) and commit
        each via SEPARATE `/commit-push` (e.g., `build(diagnostics): add X to
        Y.sh — surfaced by {plan}/section-{NN}.1 retrospective`). Use a valid
        conventional-commit type — `build` for dev/diagnostic scripts, `test`
        for test-harness changes, `chore` for general tooling, `ci` for CI
        config, `docs` for tool docs. Do NOT use `tools(...)` — the lefthook
        commit-msg hook rejects any type outside the standard set. Mandatory
        even when nothing felt painful — that is exactly when blind spots
        accumulate. If genuinely no gaps, document briefly: "Retrospective
        {NN}.1: no tooling gaps — relied on existing scripts X, Y." Do not
        silently skip. See `.claude/skills/improve-tooling/SKILL.md`
        "Per-Subsection Workflow" for the full protocol.
  - [ ] **Run `/sync-claude` on THIS subsection** — check whether the code
        changes in {NN}.1 invalidated any claims in CLAUDE.md,
        `.claude/rules/*.md`, or `canon.md`. Three quick questions: (1) Did I
        add/rename/remove any public API, type, variant, or function? → Check
        the relevant rules file. (2) Did I add/change any command, env var, or
        script? → Check CLAUDE.md §Commands. (3) Did I change any pipeline
        phase behavior or output invariant? → Check `canon.md`. If all three
        are "no," document briefly: "Claude artifact sync {NN}.1: no
        API/command/phase changes — artifacts current." Fix any drift NOW and
        commit via `/commit-push` (e.g., `docs(rules): update typeck.md —
        new desugar added in {NN}.1`). Do not silently skip.
  - [ ] **Repo hygiene check** — run `diagnostics/repo-hygiene.sh --check` and
        clean any temp/scratch files (debug dumps, one-off test scripts, editor
        backups) that accumulated during this subsection. If files are found,
        run `diagnostics/repo-hygiene.sh --clean` to remove them. This keeps the
        worktree free of detritus that obscures real changes in `git status`.

---

## {NN}.2 {Subsection with Design Decisions}

**File(s):** `{file path(s)}`

**Context:** {The problem requiring a design decision.}

{Detailed analysis of the problem — what was tried, what failed, why.
Include debugging traces, root cause analysis, data from experiments.}

**Fix approach — {N} options:**

**(a) {Recommended approach}** (recommended — {why}):
{Detailed description with code examples.}

\`\`\`rust
// Target implementation
\`\`\`

**Why this is best:** {Justify against alternatives. Cite the
architectural principle it upholds.}

**Trade-off:** {What this approach costs or complicates.}

**(b) {Alternative approach}** ({characterization}):
{Description with code.}
**Downside:** {Why this is worse than (a).}

**(c) {Least recommended}** (not recommended):
{Brief description.}
**Downside:** {Why.}

**Recommended path:** Option (a) for {reason}, with option (b) as
acceptable interim if {condition}.

- [ ] **TPR checkpoint** — `/tpr-review` covering {NN}.1–{NN}.2 implementation work
  <!-- For sections with 3+ implementation subsections, place intermediate
       TPR checkpoints after every 2-3 completed subsections. This catches
       design drift, missed edge cases, and hygiene issues BEFORE they
       compound across the remaining subsections. The checkpoint item lives
       at the end of the last subsection in the group. -->

- [ ] **Subsection close-out ({NN}.2)** — MANDATORY before starting {NN}.3:
  - [ ] All tasks above are `[x]` and the subsection's behavior is verified
  - [ ] Update this subsection's `status` in section frontmatter to `complete`
  - [ ] **Run `/improve-tooling` retrospectively on THIS subsection** — same
        protocol as {NN}.1's close-out, scoped to {NN}.2's debugging journey.
        Commit improvements separately using a valid conventional-commit type:
        `build(diagnostics): ... — surfaced by {plan}/section-{NN}.2
        retrospective` (or `test(...)`, `chore(...)`, etc — see {NN}.1's
        close-out for the type rules).
  - [ ] **Repo hygiene check** — run `diagnostics/repo-hygiene.sh --check` and
        clean any detected temp files (see {NN}.1's close-out for details).

### {Sub-topic within the subsection}

**Discovery:** {What was learned during investigation that changes
the approach or adds requirements.}

**Implementation steps:**
1. {Specific, numbered, actionable step with file path}
2. {Step referencing specific functions to modify}
3. {Validation step — what test to run, what output to expect}

**Reference implementations:**
- **{Language}** `{file}`: {what it does} — {what we adopt from it}

**Co-implementation requirement with Section {NN} ({topic}):**
{Why this subsection and another section's work must land together.
What breaks if only one lands. Be specific about the failure mode.}

---

## {NN}.R Third Party Review Findings

<!-- Reserved for the dual-source `/tpr-review` (Codex + Gemini) and other external reviewers. Findings may be tagged `-codex`, `-gemini`, or carry `agreement: true` when both reviewers flagged the same location/title.
If unresolved findings exist here:
- section frontmatter `status` must be `in-progress`
- `third_party_review.status` must be `findings`

When all findings are triaged:
- accepted findings are integrated into the relevant implementation subsection(s)
- rejected findings are closed with rationale
- all items in this block are marked resolved
- `third_party_review.status` becomes `resolved` or `none`
-->

- None.

---

## {NN}.N Completion Checklist

- [ ] {Concrete, verifiable item — not "implement X" but "X passes test Y"}
- [ ] {Item with specific command to verify: `grep -r "pattern" path/` returns 0}
- [ ] {Behavioral verification: `test_name` passes without modification}
- [ ] {Regression check: `cargo test --all` green}
- [ ] {No spurious warnings in normal compilation}
- [ ] Plan annotation cleanup: `bash .claude/skills/impl-hygiene-review/plan-annotations.sh --plan {NN}` returns 0 annotations — all temporary scaffolding (TPR, CROSS, BUG, §, Phase, section- refs) removed from `.rs` files
- [ ] All intermediate TPR checkpoint findings resolved (see checkpoint items in subsections above)
- [ ] **Plan sync** — update plan metadata to reflect this section's completion:
  - [ ] This section's frontmatter `status` → `complete`, subsection statuses updated
  - [ ] `00-overview.md` Quick Reference table status updated for this section
  - [ ] `00-overview.md` mission success criteria checkboxes updated (check off any now satisfied)
  - [ ] `index.md` section status updated
  - [ ] Cross-links to other plans updated if this section resolved external blockers (`<!-- resolved-by: ... -->`)
  - [ ] Next section's `depends_on` verified — no stale assumptions from this section's work
- [ ] `/tpr-review` passed (final, full-section) — independent dual-source review (Codex + Gemini) found no critical or major issues (or all findings from both reviewers triaged)
- [ ] `/impl-hygiene-review` passed — implementation hygiene review found no critical or major findings (or all findings triaged and fixed). MUST run AFTER `/tpr-review` is clean.
- [ ] `/improve-tooling` **section-close sweep** — MANDATORY safety net after both reviews are clean. The PRIMARY tooling capture happens per-subsection (see each subsection's close-out block above) — by section close those captures should already be committed. The sweep does TWO things: (1) **Verify** every subsection in this section has either an "improvements made" entry (with commits) or a documented "no gaps" negative finding from its own per-subsection retrospective; if any subsection skipped its retrospective, STOP and run it now — the sweep cannot substitute for missed per-subsection captures. (2) **Look for cross-subsection patterns** invisible at per-item scope: command sequences repeated when transitioning between *different* subsections, integration test failures with worse messages than within-subsection failures, mental cross-referencing across files no tool combined, instrumentation that only became obvious after seeing all subsections together. Add ONLY new items that emerged from these cross-cutting patterns — do not duplicate per-subsection findings. Implement immediately (zero deferral), commit separately using a valid conventional-commit type (`build(diagnostics): add X — surfaced by section-{NN} close sweep` — use `build` for dev/diagnostic scripts, `test` for test-harness, `chore` for general tooling, `ci` for CI, `docs` for tool docs; the lefthook commit-msg hook rejects any non-standard type), verify against the original scenario. Most sweeps produce zero new findings when per-subsection captures are thorough — that is the expected, healthy outcome and must be documented: "Section-close sweep: per-subsection retrospectives covered everything; no cross-subsection patterns required new tooling." Do not silently skip.
- [ ] `/sync-claude` **section-close doc sync** — MANDATORY after `/improve-tooling` sweep. Run `/sync-claude` across ALL commits in the section (use `git diff --name-only <section-start>..HEAD` to identify changed crates). Map each changed crate to its rules file (see `/sync-claude` §Step 2 mapping table), verify CLAUDE.md §Commands/§Key Paths/§Feature Flags, verify `canon.md` if any pipeline phase was touched, verify `ori-syntax.md` if prelude/keywords/operators changed. Fix any drift NOW and commit via `/commit-push` (e.g., `docs(rules): update typeck.md — section {NN} changes`). Per-subsection `/sync-claude` captures should have caught most drift already — this sweep verifies nothing was missed and catches cumulative drift invisible at per-subsection scope. If no drift found, document: "Claude artifact sync section {NN}: per-subsection syncs covered everything; no additional drift." Do not silently skip.
- [ ] **Repo hygiene check** — run `diagnostics/repo-hygiene.sh --check`. If temp files detected, run `--clean` to remove debug dumps, scratch scripts, editor backups, and other detritus before final commit.

**Exit Criteria:** {Paragraph describing the measurable, testable condition
that proves this section is complete. Include specific commands, test names,
metric thresholds. Not "X works" but "X produces Y output when Z command
is run, with 0 regressions in test suite A (N tests) and test suite B (M tests)."}
```

## Skill/Infra/Docs Plan Variant

When the plan's type (set at `/create-plan` Phase 0.5) is `skill-infra-docs`, the Section File Template above is too heavyweight. Skill/infra/docs plans do not alter compiler correctness invariants, do not need dual-source `/tpr-review` / `/impl-hygiene-review` gates, and do not benefit from matrix testing + semantic/negative pins the way compiler work does. Applying the full template to them produces post-creation cleanup debt — as experienced during `plan-bug-dag-ingestion` (2026-04-17) where 234 lines of compiler rigor had to be manually stripped across 6 sections after the plan was written.

This variant section specifies the reductions. Use it only when `plan_type: skill-infra-docs` is set in `00-overview.md` frontmatter.

### What stays the same

- Directory layout (`index.md` + `00-overview.md` + `section-NN-*.md`)
- Frontmatter shape (section ID, title, status, goal, `success_criteria`, `inspired_by`, `depends_on`, `third_party_review`, `sections:` list)
- `## Intelligence Reconnaissance` block (mandatory for all PLAN_SECTION files — reconnaissance value is plan-type-independent)
- Numbered subsection structure (`{NN}.1`, `{NN}.2`, …)
- Completion subsection (`{NN}.N`)
- Per-subsection tasks, code examples, context paragraphs, reference implementations, design decision blocks

### What changes

**Frontmatter differences:**
- `reviewed: true` (default) — not `false`. Skill/infra plans are low-correctness-risk and don't undergo pre-implementation `/review-plan` re-review gating. Flipping to `true` up front prevents unnecessary review cycles that would delay execution.
- No `- id: "{NN}.R"` entry in the `sections:` list — §NN.R Third Party Review Findings is compiler-rigor scaffolding that skill/infra plans don't use.
- `third_party_review: { status: none, updated: null }` stays — it's schema-required, but its value remains `none` throughout the plan's life.

**Body differences:**
- **OMIT** the entire `## {NN}.R Third Party Review Findings` block (the `- None.` placeholder subsection between the last implementation subsection and the completion checklist). Skill/infra plans don't accumulate TPR findings, so reserving the block wastes template bytes.
- **OMIT** `- [ ] **TPR checkpoint** — /tpr-review covering {NN}.1–{NN}.M` items from subsections. These exist for compiler-rigor plans with 3+ implementation subsections; skill/infra plans don't run `/tpr-review`.
- **OMIT** per-subsection `/improve-tooling` retrospective + `/sync-claude` retrospective items from subsection close-out blocks. Skill/infra work is not correctness-critical; the tooling-retrospective ritual is overkill. Keep the `Update this subsection's status to complete` + `Repo hygiene check` items from close-outs.
- **OMIT** matrix testing dimensions, semantic pins, and negative pins from success criteria and subsection tasks. Skill/infra tests are typically unit tests or end-to-end smoke tests, not type × pattern matrices.

**Completion checklist differences (the big reduction):**

Compiler template completion checklist (Section File Template §NN.N) has ~11 gates including `/tpr-review`, `/impl-hygiene-review`, `/improve-tooling` section-close sweep, `/sync-claude` section-close doc sync. For skill/infra/docs plans, the completion checklist collapses to:

```markdown
## {NN}.N Completion Checklist

- [ ] All implementation subsections ({NN}.1..{NN}.M) are `[x]` and status `complete`
- [ ] All success criteria (section frontmatter) have corresponding `[x]` checkboxes
- [ ] {domain-specific test command passes, e.g. `pytest tests/plan-audit/test_foo.py`}
- [ ] `cargo test --all` green — regression canary (no compiler code was touched in this plan; any test failure indicates an unrelated regression that must be investigated)
- [ ] `python -m scripts.plan_corpus check plans/{plan-name}/section-{NN}-*.md` returns exit 0
- [ ] **Plan sync** — update plan metadata:
  - [ ] This section's frontmatter `status` → `complete`, all subsection statuses → `complete`
  - [ ] `00-overview.md` Quick Reference table: Section {NN} status → `Complete`
  - [ ] `00-overview.md` mission success criteria: check off criteria satisfied by this section
  - [ ] `index.md` Section {NN} status → `Complete`
- [ ] **Repo hygiene check** — run `diagnostics/repo-hygiene.sh --check`; clean any detected temp/scratch files before final commit.

**Exit Criteria:** {Practical measurable condition — e.g., "`pytest tests/foo.py` passes all N tests; `scripts/intel-query.sh <subcommand>` smoke test exits 0; `cargo test --all` green."}
```

**What is NOT present** compared to the full template:
- `/tpr-review` passed (final, full-section) — OMITTED
- `/impl-hygiene-review` passed — OMITTED
- `/improve-tooling` section-close sweep — OMITTED
- `/sync-claude` section-close doc sync — OMITTED
- Plan annotation cleanup — OMITTED (skill/infra plans don't add code annotations)
- Matrix testing verification — OMITTED
- Semantic/negative pin verification — OMITTED
- Intermediate TPR checkpoint findings — OMITTED (no TPR checkpoints exist)

### Verification section (final section) variant

If the plan includes a verification section (e.g., `section-NN-verification.md`), it is ALSO simpler than the full Verification Section Template below. Drop:
- `## {NN}.4 Safety Verification` — compiler-safety concepts don't apply
- `## {NN}.5 Performance Validation` — generally not load-bearing for skill work (include only if performance is actually a concern)
- Any `/review-plan` final consensus subsection (`{NN}.6` in the full template) — `/review-plan` is optional for skill/infra/docs plans
- `§NN.R` Third Party Review Findings — no TPR
- `/tpr-review` / `/impl-hygiene-review` / `/improve-tooling` section-close sweep from the Completion Checklist

Keep:
- `## {NN}.1 Test Matrix` — but scope it to "functional coverage" rather than "type × pattern × feature" compiler matrix
- `## {NN}.2 Behavioral Equivalence` — if the plan has an equivalence property to verify (e.g., full-rebuild vs incremental producing identical output)
- `## {NN}.6 Documentation` — skill/infra plans often touch documentation; keep this subsection
- Cross-plan review invalidation if the plan could invalidate other plans' `reviewed: true` state (use `python3 .claude/skills/plan-audit/plan-invalidate.py` — lightweight, no dual-source review needed)

### When NOT to use this variant

- If the plan touches compiler code even incidentally: use full Section File Template (plan type is `compiler`, not `skill-infra-docs`).
- If the plan modifies test-gate behavior (`test-all.sh`, `clippy-all.sh`, pre-commit hooks that enforce correctness): use full template — these are correctness infrastructure.
- If the plan is for spec/grammar work: use `spec-grammar` plan type with full rigor + spec-proposal gate.
- If the user says "do this properly" or "use the full plan": user override beats the variant; use the full template even for skill/infra scope.

### Example: skill/infra section completion checklist actually used in `plan-bug-dag-ingestion` (2026-04-17)

```markdown
## 01.N Completion Checklist

- [ ] `scripts/plan_corpus/schemas.py`: `touches: list[str] | None = None` added to `PlanSectionSchema` and `FixBugSchema`
- [ ] `scripts/plan_corpus/types.py`: `SourceKind.EXPLICIT_SUPERSEDES` and `SourceKind.EXPLICIT_REFERENCES` added
- [ ] `scripts/plan_corpus/dag.py`: `_EDGE_KINDS` frozenset in place; classifiers filter to `EXPLICIT_DEPENDS_ON`
- [ ] `pytest tests/plan-audit/test_export_json.py` green (5 tests)
- [ ] `pytest tests/plan-audit/test_dag.py` green — no regression
- [ ] `python -m scripts.plan_corpus docgen --check` returns exit 0
- [ ] `cargo test --all` green — no regressions
- [ ] **Plan sync** — status flips, overview updates, index.md update
- [ ] **Repo hygiene check** — `diagnostics/repo-hygiene.sh --check` clean

**Exit Criteria:** `python -m scripts.plan_corpus docgen --check` exits 0; `pytest tests/plan-audit/test_export_json.py` and `pytest tests/plan-audit/test_dag.py` green; `cargo test --all` green.
```

Notice: no `/tpr-review`, no `/impl-hygiene-review`, no `/improve-tooling` sweep, no `/sync-claude` sweep, no matrix testing, no §NN.R. This is what a skill/infra section close-out looks like when the variant is applied correctly at creation time rather than stripped after the fact.

---

## Verification Section Template

Every plan should include a verification section (typically the last section). This proves the system works as one cohesive whole.

```markdown
## {NN}.1 Test Matrix

Build a comprehensive test matrix covering every feature through the
pipeline being built/modified.

- [ ] **{Feature category}:** ({date started})
  - {Sub-feature} — {status: covered (file.rs) | FIXED (date) | gap: reason (#[ignore])}
  - {Sub-feature} — {status}

### {NN}.1.1 Discovered Gaps

| Gap | Roadmap Location | Test | Severity |
|-----|-----------------|------|----------|
| {Description} | {Section reference} | `test_name` | CRITICAL / Medium / Low |

---

## {NN}.2 Behavioral Equivalence (if applicable)

Verify that the new path produces identical results to the existing path.

- [ ] Build a test harness comparing outputs: {description}
- [ ] Apply to all relevant tests
- [ ] Track and investigate every mismatch
- [ ] Create a CI-runnable script

---

## {NN}.3 Code Journey (Pipeline Integration)

Run `/code-journey` to test the pipeline end-to-end with progressively
complex Ori programs. This catches issues that unit tests and spec tests
miss: silent wrong code generation, phase boundary mismatches, cascading
failures across compiler stages, and eval-vs-LLVM behavioral divergence.

- [ ] Run `/code-journey` — journeys escalate until the compiler breaks down
- [ ] All CRITICAL findings from journey results triaged (fixed or tracked)
- [ ] Eval and AOT paths produce identical results for all passing journeys
- [ ] Journey results archived in `plans/code-journeys/`

**Why this matters:** Unit tests verify individual phases in isolation.
Code journeys verify that phases compose correctly — data flows through
the full pipeline (lexer → parser → type checker → canonicalizer →
eval/LLVM) and produces correct results. They use differential testing
(eval path as oracle for LLVM path) and progressive complexity
escalation to map the exact boundary of what works.

**When to run:**
- After any change to phase boundaries (new IR nodes, new type variants)
- After changes to monomorphization, ARC pipeline, or codegen
- After adding new language features that affect multiple phases
- As final verification before marking a plan complete

---

## {NN}.4 Safety Verification (if applicable)

- [ ] **{Safety property}:** {How it's verified, what tool/technique}
- [ ] **Stress test:** {Scale — N allocations, N recursion depth, N elements}
- [ ] **{Tool} verification:** {Script path, what it catches}

---

## {NN}.5 Performance Validation

- [ ] **{Metric 1}:** Measured {what} ({conditions}):
  - {Workload A}: ~{value}
  - {Workload B}: ~{value}
  - Script: `{script path}`
  - Benchmark programs: `{path}`

- [ ] **{Metric 2}:** {comparison}:
  - {result with concrete numbers}

- [ ] **{Metric 3}:** {measurement}:
  - {result}

---

## {NN}.6 Documentation

- [ ] Update superseded plans to point to this plan
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if new commands/paths/patterns introduced
- [ ] Update relevant .claude/rules/*.md files
- [ ] Add architecture overview to key module docs

---

## {NN}.7 Completion Checklist

- [ ] Test matrix covers all features (every checkbox in {NN}.1)
- [ ] Behavioral equivalence verified ({script} passes — 0 mismatches)
- [ ] Code journey passes — eval/AOT match, no CRITICAL findings unaddressed
- [ ] Zero {safety violations} detected
- [ ] Stress tests pass ({N}/{M})
- [ ] Performance baselined
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] Plan annotation cleanup: `plan-annotations.sh` returns 0 annotations for this plan's sections
- [ ] `cargo test --all` green
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings` green
- [ ] `/tpr-review` passed — independent dual-source review (Codex + Gemini) clean
- [ ] `/impl-hygiene-review` passed — hygiene review clean. MUST run AFTER `/tpr-review` is clean.
- [ ] `/improve-tooling` **section-close sweep** — MANDATORY after both reviews are clean. Per-subsection captures from {NN}.1–{NN}.6 should already be committed via each subsection's own close-out block; the sweep verifies they ran (no skips) and adds only NEW cross-cutting items invisible at per-item scope. Verification sections especially benefit from cross-cutting capture because they exercise the full diagnostic surface — but the *primary* tooling growth still happens per-subsection. Look for: diagnostic scripts that were run during multiple subsections with the same output-interpretation friction, manual cross-referencing across dumps that no tool combined, stress-test or perf instrumentation that became obvious only after seeing the full verification picture. Implement immediately, commit separately using a valid conventional-commit type (`build(diagnostics): add X — surfaced by section-{NN} verification close sweep` — see the regular section-close sweep above for the type rules; the lefthook commit-msg hook rejects non-standard types like `tools(...)`), verify against the original scenario. Document the negative finding if there are no cross-cutting gaps. Do not silently skip.

**Exit Criteria:** {Final measurable proof. Include test counts, metric
thresholds, and the specific commands that demonstrate completion.}
```

---

## Status Conventions

### Section and Subsection Status (section files, `00-overview.md`)

| YAML Status | Meaning | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `not-started` | No work done | |
| `in-progress` | Partial completion | Include date + current state in header |
| `complete` | All done | Include completion date in header |

Sections AND subsections use the same values: `not-started`, `in-progress`, `complete`. Do NOT use `done` — always use `complete`.

### Plan-Level Status (`index.md` — website-facing)

| YAML Status | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `active` | Currently being worked on |
| `queued` | Waiting in queue (lower `order` = promoted first) |
| `resolved` | Completed and archived |

Do NOT use `done` or `complete` in `index.md` — always use `resolved` for finished plans.

### Reroute Lifecycle — Canonical Algorithm

The `order` field on a reroute is not a free-form number. It is a strictly-monotonic position in a **single global queue** that `/continue-roadmap` uses to decide which plan to work on first. Every reroute (active OR queued, in any plan directory) has a unique `order` value in this shared namespace.

**Invariants (checked by the roadmap scanner and by `/create-plan` Step 18):**

1. **Uniqueness**: no two reroutes share an `order` value — not within the active set, not within the queued set, and not across sets.
2. **Monotonic insertion**: when inserting a new reroute at position N, every existing reroute with `order >= N` shifts down by 1 (its order becomes `order + 1`). Reroutes with `order < N` are unchanged.
3. **The sentinel `999`**: a reroute with no explicit `order:` field is treated as `order: 999` ("parked at the bottom, no priority"). Multiple plans may share `999` because it means "unspecified". But if an explicit order of `999` is set, it becomes a concrete position that participates in uniqueness.
4. **Active before queued at the same logical priority**: when a queued plan is promoted to active, its order does NOT change — it keeps the same numeric value. This means queued plans must be numbered AFTER active plans in the global namespace, so promotion is a metadata-only change.
5. **Main roadmap is never a reroute**: `plans/roadmap/` does not participate in the queue. It is the fallback that `/continue-roadmap` scans when no active reroute exists.

**Insertion algorithm** (used by `/create-plan` Step 18):

```
Given: new_order N, all_reroutes = scan plans/*/index.md
For each r in all_reroutes where r.order >= N and r.order != 999:
    r.order = r.order + 1
    write r back to its index.md
Set the new plan's order = N, write to its index.md
```

**Promotion algorithm** (used when an active reroute completes and the next queued reroute takes over):

```
Given: completing_plan (the one just finished), queued = all reroutes with status: queued
If queued is empty:
    mark completing_plan status: resolved
    done — no promotion
Else:
    next = queued with minimum order (must be unique by invariant 1)
    mark completing_plan status: resolved
    mark next status: active
    order is UNCHANGED — it was already numbered ahead of future queued plans
```

**Demotion algorithm** (used when the user manually reprioritizes an active plan to queued):

```
Given: demoting_plan
demoting_plan.status = queued
demoting_plan.order is UNCHANGED — it stays at its current position in the global queue
No other plans shift.
```

**Sync surface** (every place that must be updated when reroute status changes):

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `plans/<plan>/index.md` | `reroute`, `status`, `order`, `name`, `full_name` fields |
| `plans/<plan>/00-overview.md` | Top-level `status:` field (must match `index.md` `status`, using `in-progress` for `active` and `complete` for `resolved`) |

**NOT in the sync surface** (intentionally):
- Section files — section status is independent of reroute status
- Quick Reference / Estimated Effort tables in 00-overview.md — those track section progress, not reroute position
- `plans/roadmap/00-overview.md` — the main roadmap doesn't track per-reroute positions; the scanner discovers them dynamically

### Completed Plans

When all sections are `complete`, the plan is archived:
1. Set `index.md` status to `resolved`
2. Set `00-overview.md` status to `complete`
3. Move to `plans/completed/` via `git mv`

**Progress tracking conventions:**
- `[x]` — completed (include date: `(2026-02-24)`)
- `[ ]` — not started
- `**FIXED** (date)` — a bug discovered and fixed during implementation
- `#[ignore]` — test exists but is skipped due to known gap
- Commit references: `(committed c1c1b534)` for traceability
- Strikethrough `~~text~~` for gaps that were fixed (preserves history)

## Writing Principles

### Context Over Brevity
Each section should be self-contained enough that someone can understand
WHY the work exists, not just WHAT to do. Include the bug report, the
debugging session insight, the architectural principle that motivates it.

### Rules Woven In, Not Assumed
Plans cannot assume the implementer has CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/*.md`
loaded in context. Every section must embed the specific rules that
govern its work — woven organically into checklist items, constraints,
and callouts. If a rule applies, it appears in the task description
itself: "Add `FooVariant` — update ALL match arms (`file.rs:123`,
`other.rs:456`)" rather than "Add variant (check sync points)." The
plan is a self-contained execution document. Relevant rule files:
`tests.md` (TDD, matrix testing), `compiler.md` (file size, crate
ordering, API design), `registry.md` (sync points), `arc.md` (AIMS
invariants), `impl-hygiene.md` (bloat/waste/drift categories),
`runtime.md`, `llvm.md`, `eval.md`, `parse.md`, `ir.md`, etc.

### Measurable Exit Criteria
"Implement X" is not an exit criterion. "{Command} produces {output}
with 0 failures across {N} tests" is. Every section ends with a
testable, verifiable condition.

### Success Criteria Hierarchy
The plan has mission-level success criteria in `00-overview.md`. Each
section has its own success criteria. Section criteria are the building
blocks — when every section meets its criteria, the mission criteria
must follow. Every mission criterion must trace to at least one section
that delivers it, and every section criterion must trace upward to at
least one mission criterion it contributes to. A section without
success criteria is not executable. A mission criterion that no section
delivers is a gap in the plan.

### Design Decisions with Trade-offs
When there are multiple approaches, document all of them with pros/cons.
Mark the recommended approach and explain why. This prevents re-litigating
decisions and helps future readers understand the reasoning.

### Cross-References
Link sections that interact. When Section A depends on Section B,
explain the specific failure mode if only one lands. Use
"Co-implementation requirement" callouts for hard dependencies.

### Root Cause Analysis
When a bug or design flaw motivated a section, include the root cause
chain. "X broke because Y, which happened because Z, which is
fundamentally caused by W." This prevents surface-level fixes.

### TPR Cadence — Review Early, Review Often
Don't save `/tpr-review` for the very end of a section. For sections
with 3+ implementation subsections, place **intermediate TPR checkpoints**
after every 2-3 completed subsections of finished work. This catches
design drift, hygiene violations, and missed edge cases *before* they
compound across remaining subsections — fixing an issue in subsection 2
is cheap; discovering it after subsection 6 means rework across 4
subsections. The final TPR in the Completion Checklist still runs as a
full-section integration review. Larger, more complex subsections
(high estimated lines, cross-crate changes, new data flow paths) should
trigger a checkpoint sooner rather than later.

### Reference Implementations
Cite specific files from reference compilers/projects. Not "Rust does
this" but "Rust's `rustc_codegen_llvm/mir/operand.rs` uses the
`OperandValue` pattern where {description}." Include the path so the
reference can be consulted.

---

## Bug Tracker Section Schema

Bug entries live as markdown bullet items inside `plans/bug-tracker/section-NN-*.md` files. Each entry has a structured header + indented body. The body MAY carry **lifecycle markers** that route the bug to the correct workflow when scanners (`/continue-roadmap`'s `roadmap_scan.py`, `/fix-next-bug`'s `bug_queue_scan.py`) inventory it.

### Section file structure

Each `section-NN-*.md` file uses the `BugTrackerSectionSchema` frontmatter (defined in `scripts/plan_corpus/schemas.py`):

```yaml
---
section: "04"
title: "Codegen & LLVM"
status: open                    # open | resolved
goal: "Track and resolve all known codegen/LLVM bugs"
sections: []                    # bug-tracker sections have flat structure
---

# Section 04: Codegen & LLVM

## Open Bugs

- [ ] `[BUG-04-NNN][severity]` **Title** ...
  Repro: ...
  Subsystem: ...
  Found: YYYY-MM-DD | Source: <provenance>
  {optional lifecycle markers — see below}

## Resolved Bugs

- [x] `[BUG-04-NNN][severity]` **Title**
  Resolved: ... | Fix: plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-04-NNN.md
```

### Bug entry format (canonical, parsed by `plan_corpus.bug_markers`)

```markdown
- [{checkbox}] `[BUG-{section:02d}-{ordinal:03d}][{severity}]` **{Title}**
  Repro: {test file path or minimal repro steps}
  Subsystem: {crate/file path}
  Found: {YYYY-MM-DD} | Source: {provenance}
  {one or more optional lifecycle marker lines}
```

- `{checkbox}` is space (` `) for open, `x`/`X` for fixed.
- `{severity}` is `critical | high | medium | low`. Reclassification syntax `[critical→medium]` or `[critical->medium]` is supported (RHS is the effective severity).
- Backticks around `[BUG-...]` are preserved by convention but parser tolerates either.
- Trailing text after the closing `**` of the title is permitted (e.g., `**Title** — found by tpr-review`).

### Lifecycle markers (the routing-signal SSOT)

Markers are scanned by `scripts/plan_corpus/bug_markers.py::classify_bug_exclusion`. Precedence (first match wins):

| # | Marker | Routing | Auto-fixable? |
|---|--------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | `Superseded by: <plan-path>` | Use `/continue-roadmap <plan>` — the plan owns the fix | YES (auto-inserted from plan frontmatter `supersedes:` declaration by `/continue-roadmap` Step 2c) |
| 2 | `Escalated to plan: <reason>` / `Escalated: <reason>` | User must `/create-plan` | NO |
| 3 | `**Blocked**: <reason>` / `Blocked: <reason>` | Waiting on dependency; user resolves manually | NO |
| 4 | `<!-- blocked-by:BUG-XX-NNN -->` | Cross-section blocker tag | NO |

**`**BLOCKER**:` is NOT a lifecycle marker.** It's informational impact text describing what the bug blocks downstream (e.g. `**BLOCKER**: This blocks ~800 spec tests`). The substring distinction (`**BLOCKER**` vs `**Blocked**:`) is enforced by the SSOT regex (`BUG_BLOCKED_RE = r"(?im)^\s*\*{0,2}blocked\*{0,2}\s*:"`).

### Bidirectional supersede invariant

The `Superseded by:` marker has TWO endpoints that MUST agree:

1. **Bug entry side**: the marker line in the bug-tracker section file.
2. **Plan side**: the plan's `00-overview.md` frontmatter `supersedes:` field listing the corresponding `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md` path.

Either direction missing is `bug_marker_drift`:

- **Missing bug-side marker** (plan claims, bug doesn't declare) — auto-fixed silently by `/continue-roadmap` Step 2c. The plan frontmatter is the authoritative SSOT; the bug-side marker is derived.
- **Orphan bug-side marker** (bug declares, plan doesn't claim) — surfaced as info finding, NOT auto-fixed. User must reconcile.

### Enforcement (referenced by `/continue-roadmap`)

The schema is enforced at `/continue-roadmap` invocation time by:

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `scripts/plan_corpus/bug_markers.py` | Marker regex SSOT, `BugEntry` dataclass, `parse_bug_entries()`, `classify_bug_exclusion()`. Both `roadmap_scan.py` and `bug_queue_scan.py` import from here — duplicating regexes elsewhere is a `LEAK:algorithmic-duplication` violation. |
| `scripts/plan_corpus/bug_validators.py` | Bidirectional drift detector (`find_supersede_drift()`), planned-edit generator (`plan_auto_fixes()`), idempotent applier (`apply_planned_edits()`). |
| `roadmap_scan.py` Gate 1.6 | Computes drift report into `gates.bug_marker_drift` payload (auto-fix severity). |
| `/continue-roadmap` workflow.md Step 2c | Sub-agent applies the planned edits inline via the Edit tool, then commits everything together in Step 2d. |

To extend the marker vocabulary (e.g., add a future `Wontfix:` lifecycle state), edit `bug_markers.py`'s precedence list ONLY — both consumers and the auto-fix gate pick up the change automatically.

---

## Bug Fix Section Template

Bug fixes use a lighter-weight section file that lives in the bug tracker (`plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md`). Created by the `/fix-bug` command, these follow the same rigor as plan sections but are scoped to a single bug or cluster of related bugs.

```markdown
---
bug: "BUG-{section}-{ordinal}"
title: "{Bug title}"
severity: "{critical|high|medium|low}"
status: not-started
goal: "{One-line measurable goal}"
success_criteria:
  - "{Criterion 1 — specific, testable}"
  - "{Criterion 2 — with verification command}"
subsystem: "{crate/file path}"
found: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
source: "{tpr-review|code-journey|manual|continue-roadmap|review-work}"
third_party_review:
  status: none
  updated: null
---

# Fix: BUG-{section}-{ordinal} — {Title}

**Status:** Not Started
**Severity:** {severity}
**Goal:** {Expanded goal — not 'fix X' but 'X correctly handles Y under conditions Z'}

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] {Criterion — specific behavioral outcome with verification}
- [ ] {Criterion — test name or command}

**Context:** {Why this bug exists. How it was discovered. 2-4 sentences.}

---

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

- **Symptom**: {What was observed}
- **Proximate cause**: {What code produced the wrong behavior}
- **Root cause**: {Why — the architectural/logical flaw}
- **Blast radius**: {What else is affected}
- **Affected files**:
  - `{file}` — {what changes and why}

**Reference implementations** (if applicable):
- **{Language}** `{file}`: {How they handle this case}

---

## 2. TDD — Test Matrix

### Exact failing case
- [ ] {From the repro}

### Edge cases
- [ ] {Boundary conditions}

### Cross-type coverage (if type-dependent)
- [ ] {Test each relevant type}

### Cross-pattern coverage (if pattern-dependent)
- [ ] {Test each relevant pattern}

### Cross-feature interactions
- [ ] {Test interaction with other features}

### Semantic pin
- [ ] {Test that ONLY passes with correct semantics}

### Negative pin
- [ ] {Test that REJECTS old/broken behavior}

### Verify tests fail before fix
- [ ] All new tests fail against current code

---

## 3. Implementation

- [ ] {Fix approach with code examples}

---

## 4. Completion Checklist

- [ ] All new tests pass unchanged after fix
- [ ] Matrix completeness verified
- [ ] Debug AND release builds pass
- [ ] Interpreter and LLVM produce identical results (dual-execution parity)
- [ ] `` zero leaks (for memory-touching fixes)
- [ ] `timeout 150 cargo test --all` green
- [ ] `timeout 150 cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings` green
- [ ] `cargo test -p {affected_crate}` green
- [ ] `/commit-push` — commit all changes before review
- [ ] Bug entry updated: `- [x]` with resolution
- [ ] Fix section status → `complete`
- [ ] Bug-tracker overview open bug count updated
- [ ] `/tpr-review` passed (critical/high: MANDATORY; medium: expected; low: recommended but not required)
- [ ] `/impl-hygiene-review` passed — AFTER TPR (critical/high: MANDATORY; medium: recommended; low: optional)
- [ ] `/improve-tooling` retrospective completed — MANDATORY at fix close, after both reviews are clean. Reflect on the bug-finding journey: which `diagnostics/` scripts you ran, where you added ad-hoc `dbg!`/`tracing` calls during root cause analysis, where the test failure messages were unhelpful, where the matrix tests were tedious to write because helpers were missing. Bug fixes are the richest source of tooling gaps because you've just spent time fighting the diagnostic surface — capture every gap you noticed. Implement every accepted improvement NOW (zero deferral) and commit each via SEPARATE `/commit-push`. Especially valuable: instrumentation/logging that would have made the root cause obvious in 1 minute instead of 30, and matrix-test helpers that future fix sections will reuse.

**Exit Criteria:** {Measurable proof of completion with test names and commands.}
```

### Key Differences from Plan Sections

| Aspect | Plan Section | Bug Fix Section |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Location | `plans/{plan}/section-NN-*.md` | `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md` |
| Scope | Feature/subsystem | Single bug or cluster |
| Subsections | Multiple ({NN}.1, {NN}.2, ...) | Four fixed sections (RCA, TDD, Impl, Checklist) |
| Research | Multi-pass (4 passes, agents) | Focused investigation |
| TPR checkpoints | After every 2-3 subsections | Final only (unless complex) |
| {NN}.R section | Reserved for TPR findings | TPR findings go in completion checklist |
| Overview sync | Mission criteria, dependency graph | Bug count in overview, entry marked resolved |

### When to Escalate to a Full Plan

If during `/fix-bug` investigation you discover the bug requires:
- Changes to 5+ files across 3+ crates
- New data types, pipeline stages, or architectural changes
