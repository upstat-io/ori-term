# Improve Tooling

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Never work around deficient tooling. Fix the tool.**

When you encounter friction, gaps, or deficiencies in any developer tooling — testing scripts, diagnostic scripts, build scripts, or any automation — you MUST improve the tool rather than working around it. The tool improvement IS the work.

**Tooling grows organically.** You cannot predict every use case ahead of time. The way the diagnostic suite gets sharp is by ratcheting it up by one improvement after every subsection, every bug fix, every debugging session — guided by what was *actually* painful, not what was imagined to be painful. This skill has two trigger modes: **reactive** (mid-task friction, the original auto-trigger) and **reflective** (post-subsection, post-bug-fix, and post-section retrospective — see Retrospective Mode below).

**Pain memory decays fast.** This is why retrospectives must fire at the smallest natural unit of work, not at section close. By the time you've finished six subsections plus TPR plus hygiene review, the friction from subsection `.1` is days old and three reviews ago — you have already smoothed over it. Retrospective Mode therefore has THREE granularities: per-subsection (the primary capture mechanism, run while the journey is fresh), bug-fix close (captures root-cause analysis friction — mandated by `/fix-bug` Phase 5), and section-close (an integration sweep that catches cross-cutting patterns invisible at finer scope).

## Trigger Conditions

This skill auto-triggers when ANY of these are true:

1. **Confusing output** — a script produces output that requires manual interpretation, is ambiguous, or buries the important information
2. **Missing coverage** — a test harness, diagnostic script, or verification tool doesn't cover a case you need
3. **Manual workaround** — you find yourself manually doing something (piping output, grepping logs, running multiple commands in sequence) that a script should automate
4. **Wrong/stale results** — a tool produces incorrect, outdated, or misleading information
5. **Missing error handling** — a script silently fails, produces no output on error, or gives cryptic error messages
6. **Missing flags/options** — you need a capability the tool doesn't expose (e.g., `--verbose`, `--filter`, `--json`, `--help`)
7. **Friction during debugging** — you spend more than 30 seconds interpreting tool output or running follow-up commands to get the information you actually need
8. **Incomplete automation** — a multi-step manual process that should be a single command

Additionally, this skill is **mandatorily invoked** as a retrospective at three boundaries — these are not optional auto-triggers but required workflow steps:

9. **Per-subsection close** — immediately after marking a plan subsection complete (see Retrospective Mode §Per-Subsection)
10. **Bug-fix close** — at `/fix-bug` Phase 5 completion checklist step 8 (see Retrospective Mode §Bug-Fix Close)
11. **Section-close sweep** — at the end of a full section, after TPR and hygiene are clean (see Retrospective Mode §Section-Close Sweep)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Deficiency

When you notice tooling friction, STOP and articulate:
- **What tool** is deficient (file path)
- **What the gap is** (missing feature, wrong output, no error handling, etc.)
- **What you were about to do instead** (the workaround you were about to use)

### Step 2: Read the Tool

Read the existing tool code. Understand:
- Its current capabilities and flags
- Its conventions (does it follow `_common.sh` patterns? Does it support `--help`?)
- Where the gap is in the code

### Step 3: Fix the Tool

Make the improvement. Follow existing conventions:
- **Shell scripts**: follow `_common.sh` patterns — `--help`, `--no-color`/`--color`, error handling, exit codes
- **Python scripts**: argparse, clear error messages, `if __name__ == "__main__"`
- **Test harnesses**: clear pass/fail output, exit code reflects success/failure, no silent swallowing of errors

### Step 4: Use the Improved Tool

Now use the improved tool for your original task. The improvement must actually solve the friction that triggered it.

### Step 5: Update Documentation

If the tool gained new flags or capabilities:
- Update `CLAUDE.md` if the tool is listed there
- Update the tool's `--help` output
- Update `scripts/README.md` or the top-level wrapper's header comment if one exists

## Anti-Patterns (BANNED)

The canonical list of banned tooling workarounds lives in `CLAUDE.md` §"ALWAYS improve tooling, NEVER work around it". All of those anti-patterns trigger this skill. In summary: any action that works *around* a tool's limitation instead of *fixing* the tool is banned — piping/grepping output, running multiple commands for one answer, manually interpreting output, ignoring wrong output, writing one-off scripts, or saying "the tool doesn't support X" and moving on.

## Quality Standards for Tool Improvements

Every tool improvement must meet these standards:

1. **`--help` works** and documents all flags
2. **Error messages are clear** — say what went wrong and what to do about it
3. **Exit codes are correct** — 0 for success, non-zero for failure
4. **Output is structured** — important info first, details available via `--verbose`
5. **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times
6. **Tested** — if adding a flag, verify it works before moving on
7. **Consistent** — follows the same conventions as sibling scripts

## Retrospective Mode

Retrospective mode is **reflective, not reactive**. It runs even when nothing felt blocked. The premise: small frictions normalize and disappear from memory within hours, so you must capture them while the debugging journey is fresh.

It has **three granularities**, fired at different boundaries:

| Granularity | Trigger | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Per-subsection** (PRIMARY) | Immediately after a subsection's tasks are all `[x]` and the subsection is marked `complete` — BEFORE moving to the next subsection | Just THIS subsection's debugging journey | Fresh-pain capture. The main mechanism by which tooling grows. |
| **Bug-fix close** | After `/fix-bug` completion checklist step 8 — AFTER TPR and hygiene are clean | The fix section's root-cause analysis and debugging journey | Bug fixes are the richest source of tooling gaps — you've just fought the diagnostic surface during root-cause analysis. Mandated by `/fix-bug` Phase 5. |
| **Section-close** (SWEEP) | At the end of a full section, after `/tpr-review` and `/impl-hygiene-review` are clean | The section as an integrated whole | Verify per-subsection and bug-fix retrospectives ran. Add only NEW items from cross-cutting patterns invisible at finer scope. Safety net, not main capture. |

**Why three granularities:** the per-subsection retrospective is where almost all real value lives — it fires while you can still remember which `dbg!` you added to chase what symptom in which file. The bug-fix close retrospective captures tooling gaps from root-cause analysis — a different debugging shape than subsection work (more diagnostic scripts, more tracing, more ad-hoc instrumentation). The section-close sweep exists because some friction is only visible *after integration*: e.g., "I noticed I ran the same 3 commands every time I switched between subsections .2 and .4" or "the test failure messages from .1 only became confusing once they collided with the new variants from .3." Without the sweep, those cross-cutting patterns get lost. Without the per-subsection and bug-fix captures, *everything* gets lost.

### Per-Subsection Workflow (PRIMARY — fires after every subsection)

When invoked immediately after marking a subsection complete:

1. **Reconstruct THIS subsection's debugging journey.** Look at exactly what you did inside this subsection's task block. Ask:
   - Which `scripts/` or the top-level wrappers (`./build-all.sh`, `./test-all.sh`, etc.) scripts did I run for this subsection? How many times? Did I have to pipe/grep/manually parse output?
   - Which command sequences did I repeat across this subsection's tasks? (e.g., "build, run with ``, grep for the function, eyeball the IR")
   - Where did I add `dbg!` / `eprintln!` / `tracing::debug!` while implementing this subsection? What was each one looking for?
   - Where did I stare at output for >30 seconds trying to understand it?
   - Which test failures gave unhelpful messages — "expected X, got Y" without context about *why*?
   - Did I write any one-off shell incantations a script should own permanently?

2. **Forward-look as well as back-look.** Ask: "If someone hits a regression in this exact code path next month, what tool/log/diagnostic would shorten their debugging session by 10 minutes?"

3. **List concrete improvement candidates** (see "Candidate Format" below).

4. **Filter brutally** (see "Filter Criteria" below).

5. **Implement accepted improvements NOW** — zero deferral. The improvement IS subsection close-out work. Do not start the next subsection until improvements are committed.

6. **Commit improvements separately** via `/commit-push` with a message like `test(teseq): add --summary flag that lists failures at the end — surfaced by {plan}/section-NN.M retrospective`. Tool improvements have their own provenance and reviewability — never bundled into the subsection's implementation commit. Use a valid conventional-commit type per `/commit-push` (e.g., `build` for dev scripts, `test` for test-harness, `chore` for general tooling, `ci` for CI, `docs` for tool docs).

7. **Verify the improvement actually solves the friction** by re-running the original workflow against the improved tool. If it doesn't noticeably help, iterate until it does.

8. **Update documentation** if the tool gained new flags — `CLAUDE.md` (if listed), the script's `--help`, `scripts/README.md` or the top-level wrapper's header comment.

**Output of a per-subsection retrospective is one of two states:**
- **Improvements made** — list each tool changed + the friction it removes, with commit hashes
- **No gaps** — document the negative finding briefly: "Retrospective: no tooling gaps — subsection {NN}.M relied entirely on existing scripts X, Y which were sufficient." The negative finding is itself the deliverable — it proves you actually looked, not that you skipped.

**Where to persist the outcome:** Record in the owning plan's subsection completion notes (e.g., append to the `[x]` line or add a sub-bullet: `Tooling retrospective: improvements in commits {hashes}` or `Tooling retrospective: no gaps`). This is the durable record that the section-close sweep checks in step 1. If no owning plan exists (ad-hoc work), record in the commit message body of the last improvement commit.

### Bug-Fix Close Workflow (fires after every `/fix-bug` completion)

When invoked at `/fix-bug` Phase 5 completion checklist step 8, AFTER TPR and hygiene are clean:

1. **Reconstruct THIS bug's debugging journey.** The scope is the fix section (`fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md`), not a plan subsection. Ask:
   - Which `scripts/` or the top-level wrappers (`./build-all.sh`, `./test-all.sh`, etc.) scripts did I run during root-cause analysis? Did any produce confusing or incomplete output?
   - Where did I add `dbg!` / `tracing::debug!` to chase the root cause? What was each one looking for? Could a script flag have surfaced the same information?
   - Where did the original failure message or test output fail to explain *why* something was wrong?
   - Did the TDD matrix writing reveal missing test helpers or assertion utilities?
   - Did I manually run ``, ``, or other environment flags that a script should orchestrate?

2. **Forward-look.** Ask: "If this same bug class recurs in a different code path, what tool/flag/diagnostic would make root-cause analysis 10 minutes faster?"

3. **List, filter, implement, commit, verify, document** — same rules as per-subsection (zero deferral, separate commits per `/commit-push`, re-run verification, update docs).

**Output:** Record in the fix section's completion checklist: either "Tooling retrospective: improvements in commits {hashes}" or "Tooling retrospective: no gaps — root-cause analysis used scripts X, Y which were sufficient." This is the durable record that the section-close sweep verifies.

### Section-Close Sweep Workflow (SAFETY NET — fires once per section)

When invoked at the end of a section, after `/tpr-review` and `/impl-hygiene-review` are clean:

1. **Verify per-subsection and bug-fix retrospectives actually ran.** For each subsection in this section, confirm there is either an "Improvements made" entry (with commits) or a documented "no gaps" negative finding. For each `/fix-bug` completed during this section, confirm the fix section's completion checklist has a "Tooling retrospective" entry. If any retrospective was skipped, **STOP** — go back and run it now. The sweep cannot substitute for the missing captures; it can only catch what they missed.

2. **Look for cross-item patterns invisible at finer granularity:**
   - Did I run the same command sequence transitioning between different subsections or between subsection work and bug-fix work? (e.g., "every time I moved from a typeck change to a codegen change, I had to manually clear the salsa cache and re-run two diagnostic scripts")
   - Did test failures from *interactions between* items (subsections, bug fixes) give worse messages than failures *within* a single item?
   - Did integration steps require mentally cross-referencing files that no tool combined?
   - Did any forward-looking instrumentation become obvious only after seeing all subsections and bug fixes together?

3. **List concrete improvement candidates** for items the per-subsection and bug-fix captures could not have surfaced (see "Candidate Format" below).

4. **Filter brutally** — and bias toward NOT duplicating per-subsection or bug-fix work. If a candidate could have been captured at finer granularity but wasn't, that's a process failure (go fix the missed retrospective), not a sweep finding.

5. **Implement, commit, verify, document** — same rules as per-subsection (zero deferral, separate commits, re-run verification).

**Output of a section-close sweep is one of two states:**
- **Cross-cutting improvements made** — list each tool changed + the integration pattern it addresses
- **No new gaps beyond finer-grained captures** — "Section-close sweep: per-subsection and bug-fix retrospectives covered everything; no cross-cutting patterns required new tooling." This is a perfectly valid (and common) outcome when finer-grained captures were thorough.

**Where to persist the outcome:** Record at the bottom of the section's plan file (e.g., as a `## Tooling Sweep` block or appended to the section's completion notes). The sweep outcome is the final verification that all finer-grained captures ran.

### Candidate Format (all granularities)

For each candidate, articulate:
- **Tool**: which script/harness needs the change (e.g., `./test-all.sh`, `cargo test -p oriterm_core --test teseq`, `oriterm/src/gpu/visual_regression/`)
- **Gap**: what's missing or painful (e.g., "teseq skip messages don't say WHY tack is unavailable on a system without libtinfo")
- **Improvement**: the specific change (e.g., "print the failing precondition in the SKIP line so the operator knows what to install")
- **Payoff**: how it would have shortened *this* item's work (subsection, bug fix, or section), or how it sharpens future debugging
- **Source**: which subsection (`{NN}.M`), bug fix (`BUG-XX-NNN`), or cross-pattern surfaced it — used in commit messages

### Filter Criteria (all granularities)

Not every small annoyance becomes a tool change. Apply this filter:

- **DO improve** if the friction would recur: same workflow on similar bugs or subsections, same script run across items, same output format misread by future implementers
- **DO improve** if the manual workaround is non-obvious — meaning it relies on tribal knowledge nobody documented
- **DO improve** if a 10-line script change saves 5+ minutes per future debugging session
- **DO NOT improve** if the friction was a one-off due to unique content (subsection or bug fix) with no recurring pattern
- **DO NOT improve** if the "fix" would add complexity to a stable, simple tool for a marginal gain

### Anti-Patterns Specific to Retrospective Mode

- **"Nothing was painful, skipping retrospective."** — The retrospective is mandatory at every subsection close, bug-fix close, and section-close sweep. The fact that nothing *felt* painful is exactly why the look-back is needed: small frictions become invisible. Force yourself to enumerate the actual commands run; gaps will surface. If genuinely none, the negative-finding documentation IS the deliverable.
- **"I'll batch all my retrospectives at section close instead."** — BANNED. This is exactly the failure mode that motivated splitting into per-subsection granularity. By section close you have already forgotten the pain points from the early subsections. The section-close sweep can ONLY catch cross-cutting patterns; it cannot reconstruct per-item friction.
- **"I'll add a TODO comment for the tool change."** — Banned. Either implement the improvement now or don't claim it's needed. Comments are not tracking.
- **"The improvement would touch 3 scripts, that's too much."** — CLAUDE.md correctness rule applies: scope, effort, and complexity are irrelevant. If the right improvement crosses scripts, that IS the improvement.
- **"This is a one-off, no future debugging session will need it."** — Be honest. If you genuinely can't articulate a recurring use case, skip it. But "one-off" is often a rationalization — most debugging patterns recur.
- **Combining tooling improvements into the item's main commit** (subsection or bug fix). — Separate commits keep provenance clean and let `/improve-tooling` retrospectives be reviewed independently of feature/fix work.
- **Section-close sweep being used as the primary capture.** — If your section-close sweep produces 8 improvements while the per-subsection and bug-fix retrospectives produced 0, the finer-grained captures were skipped. Sweep findings should be small in number (often zero) and explicitly cross-cutting.

### Why Retrospective Mode Exists

The reactive auto-trigger catches friction *as it happens*, but it has blind spots:
- Workflows that are tedious but not blocking ("I always have to run these 3 commands in a row") never trigger reactive mode because no single moment is painful enough
- Output that's *interpretable but slow* never triggers — you read it, you continue, the friction normalizes
- Forward-looking instrumentation ("logging that doesn't exist yet but would help future debugging") cannot be reactive by definition

Retrospective mode covers all three. The per-subsection cadence ensures the capture happens while memory is hot; the bug-fix close captures root-cause analysis friction (the richest source of tooling gaps); the section-close sweep ensures cross-cutting patterns aren't lost. Together, they're the difference between a tooling suite that grows by accident and one that grows on purpose.

## Examples

**Bad**: "`cargo test -p oriterm_core --test teseq` is skipping silently because `reseq` isn't installed, but the message doesn't say that — I'll just remember to check `which reseq` every time"
**Good**: Update the teseq test harness so its skip message includes the missing binary name and the install command (`sudo apt install teseq`)

**Bad**: "test-all.sh output is too long to scan, let me grep for FAIL"
**Good**: Add a summary section to `test-all.sh` that lists all failures at the end

**Bad**: "I need to compare a GPU visual-regression golden before and after my change, let me screenshot both manually and eyeball the difference"
**Good**: The visual-regression suite under `oriterm/src/gpu/visual_regression/` already produces golden images — run the suite against both commits, compare the produced PNGs with `compare` (ImageMagick) or the built-in insta snapshot diff, and if the diff output is unhelpful, improve the harness to emit a per-cell diff map.

**Bad**: "This script doesn't handle the case where the file doesn't exist"
**Good**: Add existence checks with clear error messages: `echo "Error: $file not found" >&2; exit 1`
