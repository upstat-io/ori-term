# Fix Bug

Fix a bug with the same rigor as a plan section: investigation, root cause analysis, TDD-first testing, implementation, and full completion checklist including `/tpr-review` and `/impl-hygiene-review`.

## Usage

```
/fix-bug BUG-04-033
/fix-bug BUG-02-005
/fix-bug [description of the bug if ID unknown]
/fix-bug --autopilot BUG-04-033    (called by /fix-next-bug in autopilot mode)
```

## Phase -1: Ground Truth — MANDATORY, EVERY TIME

**Before ANY other work**, re-read the project's CLAUDE.md files to ground yourself in the rules:

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** (project root) — the One Rule, ownership, deferral, TDD, fix completeness, stabilization discipline, coding guidelines, commands
2. **Read `.claude/rules/` files relevant to the bug's subsystem** — e.g., `.claude/rules/tests.md` for test patterns, `.claude/rules/registry.md` for registry bugs, `.claude/rules/arc.md` for ARC/memory bugs

This is NOT optional. Context drift across long sessions causes rule violations. Re-reading ensures every fix follows the same standard regardless of when it runs in a session.

## Autopilot Mode

When invoked with `--autopilot` (by `/fix-next-bug` in autopilot mode), the following rules apply:

- **ZERO user interaction** — do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` for any reason. Make the correct decision yourself based on CLAUDE.md rules and the spec.
- **No pausing, no stopping** — continue through every phase until the bug is fully fixed, reviewed, and committed. No matter the scope. If the correct fix touches 15 files across 4 crates, that IS the fix. Do it.
- **No hacks, no shortcuts, no workarounds** — follow CLAUDE.md's "The One Rule: Correctness Above All" with absolute fidelity. The correct fix is the ONLY fix. Scope, effort, complexity are irrelevant.
- **Full rigor is non-negotiable** — every phase (investigation, TDD matrix, implementation, TPR, hygiene) runs to completion. Autopilot means autonomous, NOT abbreviated.
- **New bugs → `/add-bug`** — file them and keep going. The `/fix-next-bug` loop will pick them up on the next re-scan.
- **Fix interference → handle it** — if a newly discovered bug blocks this fix, **shelve** the current fix, fix the blocker first via a nested `/fix-bug --autopilot`, then resume. "Shelve" means: (1) commit any partial work via `/commit-push` with message `chore(fix-bug): shelve BUG-XX-NNN — blocked by BUG-YY-MMM`, (2) note the WIP commit hash in the fix section file's implementation notes, (3) after the nested fix returns, continue from where you left off — the WIP commit keeps your partial changes safe and separate from the nested fix's commits.
- **Do NOT use `TaskCreate`** — the `/fix-next-bug` autopilot loop maintains a single persistent reminder task. Creating additional tasks would signal work completion and cause the loop to terminate prematurely. Track your progress via the fix section file, not tasks.

When NOT in autopilot mode, `AskUserQuestion` is available as normal for genuinely ambiguous decisions.

## Flaky Tests ARE Bugs — ALWAYS

If a test passes sometimes and fails sometimes, that is a bug — not noise. Do NOT retry and move on. Research the root cause (race condition, timing dependency, temp file collision, state leakage, non-deterministic ordering, filesystem caching) and fix it so the test is deterministic. If discovered during a different bug fix, file via `/add-bug` immediately.

## NEVER Investigate "Pre-existing?" — BANNED

Do NOT use `git checkout`, `git stash`, `git bisect`, `git log --diff-filter`, or any git archaeology to determine whether a bug or test failure existed before your changes. **It does not matter.** The question "was this pre-existing?" is banned. The only valid question is: "is it fixed?"

Spending time checking out old commits to see if something "was already broken" produces zero value. It's broken now → fix it now. No exceptions, no "just to understand the timeline." The timeline is irrelevant. The fix is everything.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Locate the Bug

1. **Find the bug entry** — read the bug-tracker section files to find the bug:
   ```
   plans/bug-tracker/section-{NN}-*.md
   ```
   If the user gave a description instead of an ID, search all section files for a match.

2. **If no bug entry exists yet** — create one now using the `/add-bug` entry format. This is common when a blocking bug is discovered during plan work and goes straight to `/fix-bug`. Write the entry in the appropriate section file before proceeding. Assign the next sequential ID.

3. **Extract context** from the entry: severity, repro, subsystem, source, any notes or cross-refs.

4. **Check for an existing fix file** — if `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md` already exists, resume from where it left off instead of creating a new one.

### Phase 1: Investigation (Research Before Writing)

**Do NOT start coding yet.** Understand the bug first.

1. **Read the affected code** — not just the file listed in the bug entry, but the surrounding context. Understand the data flow, the invariants, and the phase boundaries. Read at least 2-3 files that interact with the buggy code.

2. **Reproduce the bug** — run the repro from the bug entry. If it passes now, the bug may be OBE — follow the OBE exit path below.

   **OBE Exit Path** (bug already fixed by other work):
   1. Verify the fix is real — run the repro AND check that the underlying code path is actually corrected, not just coincidentally passing
   2. Update the bug entry in the section file using the canonical OBE resolution format from `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`:
      ```markdown
      - [x] `[BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}]` **{Short title}**
        Resolved: OBE on {YYYY-MM-DD}. {What fixed it — commit, plan, or rewrite}.
      ```
   3. Update `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md` Quick Reference — decrement the open bug count for this subsystem
   4. Commit via `/commit-push` (the entry update is a deliverable — it must be committed)
   5. **Return OBE outcome** — report to the caller (user or `/fix-next-bug`):
      ```
      OBE: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
        Resolved by: {what fixed it}
        Bug entry updated, overview count decremented.
      ```
   6. **Stop** — do NOT proceed to Phase 1.5 or beyond. The bug is resolved.

3. **Consult the spec** — check `docs/spec/` for the intended behavior. The spec is authoritative.

4. **Root cause analysis** — trace the bug to its *root cause*, not just the symptom. Follow the chain:
   - What was observed? (symptom)
   - What code produced this? (proximate cause)
   - Why did that code do the wrong thing? (root cause)
   - Is the root cause localized or systemic? (blast radius)

5. **Check reference compilers** (if the bug involves a design question) — consult `~/projects/reference_repos/lang_repos/` for prior art on how other compilers handle this case.

6. **Identify all affected code paths** — the fix may need changes in multiple places. List every file and function that needs to change.

### Phase 1.5: Scope Assessment — MANDATORY GATE

After investigation, assess whether this bug is a **point fix** (inline bug fix) or requires a **plan** (architectural change, cross-system redesign, multi-section work).

**Point fix criteria** (ALL must be true):
- Root cause is localized to 1-3 files
- Fix does not require redesigning an existing subsystem
- Fix does not span multiple plan sections or roadmap areas
- The "fix approach" can be described in a paragraph, not a document

**Plan escalation criteria** (ANY triggers escalation):
- Root cause is systemic — affects 4+ files across multiple crates/subsystems
- Fix requires architectural change or redesigning an existing system
- Fix involves new abstractions, new pipeline passes, or new data structures
- Fix naturally belongs as a roadmap section or plan with multiple phases
- You cannot write a TDD matrix because the fix approach itself is unclear

**If point fix** → proceed to Phase 2.

**If plan needed** → escalate:
1. **Do NOT proceed to Phase 2.** Do NOT write code. Do NOT create a fix section file.
2. **Run `/create-plan`** — create a proper plan for this work. The plan IS the deliverable.
3. **Update the bug entry** in the section file — add a note: `Escalated to plan: plans/{plan-name}/`. Do NOT mark it `[x]` — it is not fixed, it is planned.
4. **Report the escalation** to the user:
   ```
   Escalated: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
     Reason: {why this needs a plan, not an inline fix}
     Plan created: plans/{plan-name}/
     Bug entry updated with plan reference
   ```
5. **Stop.** This bug is done for `/fix-bug`. The plan will be worked separately.

**If blocked/latent** (prerequisite feature doesn't exist yet):
1. **Do NOT proceed to Phase 2.** The bug cannot be fixed because the infrastructure doesn't exist.
2. **Update the bug entry** — add a note explaining the blocker: `Blocked: {reason — e.g., "LLVM FFI codegen not yet implemented"}`. Do NOT mark it `[x]`.
3. **Report the blocker:**
   ```
   Blocked: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
     Reason: {what prerequisite is missing}
     Blocker: {roadmap section, plan, or feature that must land first}
     Bug entry updated with blocker reference
   ```
4. **Stop.** This bug is done for `/fix-bug` until the blocker is resolved.

**In autopilot mode**: the same rules apply for ALL non-point-fix outcomes, with one critical exception for `/create-plan`:

- **OBE** → follow the OBE exit path (Phase 1), return OBE outcome to caller
- **Blocked/latent** → update bug entry with `Blocked:` note, return blocked outcome to caller
- **Plan needed** → **do NOT invoke `/create-plan`** (it has mandatory interactive approval gates that conflict with autopilot's zero-interaction contract). Instead:
  1. Update the bug entry with `Escalated: requires plan — {brief reason why inline fix is insufficient}`
  2. Return escalated outcome to caller with the reason
  3. `/fix-next-bug` records this in the session summary; the user creates the plan after the autopilot run

When NOT in autopilot mode, invoke `/create-plan` normally per the escalation protocol above.

Autopilot means autonomous, not reckless. Correctly identifying that a bug needs a plan and deferring the plan creation to the interactive user IS the correct autonomous decision. The key: always return to the caller — never just "document and stop."

### Phase 1.75: Fix Consensus (via /tp-help) — MANDATORY GATE

**Before writing the fix section file, get independent dual-source consensus on the proposed fix approach.** This catches wrong-approach errors BEFORE they are locked into the fix section, the test matrix, or the implementation.

This is NOT `/tp-help`'s usual "stuck help" use case — it is **design consensus**. You have investigation + root cause (Phase 1) + a confirmed point-fix scope (Phase 1.5) + a proposed approach. You are about to commit to it in writing. Get Codex and Gemini to independently pressure-test the approach before you lock it in. The `/tp-help` skill has an explicit carve-out for this calling context (see its "What Does NOT Trigger This" → "Exception — design consensus mode").

**Skip only when:** Phase 1.5 escalated to `/create-plan` or marked blocked. Plans get their own review loops; blocked bugs have nothing to review. EVERY other bug — including "trivial" one-liners — runs through consensus. What looks trivial often has architectural implications you would want flagged.

1. **Articulate the proposed fix** — write out, in prose, for the `/tp-help` question:
   - Bug (one line) + root cause (Phase 1 output)
   - Affected files and what changes in each
   - Your proposed fix approach (what changes, where, why)
   - Alternatives you considered and why you rejected them

2. **Invoke `/tp-help`** with the articulation above as the question. The existing `/tp-help` workflow (dual-source, adversarial framing, mandatory grounding block, worktree guard) runs unchanged — the only difference is the calling context. Save the `$RUN` scratch dir path; you will cite it in § 1.5 of the fix section file.

3. **Independently verify every finding** against actual code per the `feedback_reviewer_grounding_and_trust.md` memory rule. Never trust reviewer claims blindly. Codex = HIGH trust (spot-check key claims), Gemini = LOWER trust (full verification — confabulation-prone). File:line cites are required in § 1.5 "Independent code verification".

4. **Reconcile** into one of three outcomes:
   - **Agreement** — Claude's approach + both reviewers converge → proceed to Phase 2
   - **Persuaded divergence** — reviewers propose a better approach, Claude verifies it against the code and adopts it → proceed to Phase 2 with the new approach
   - **Unpersuaded divergence** — Claude is not convinced by reviewers after code verification → run a follow-up `/tp-help` round with a counter-argument (include the prior round's responses and Claude's specific verification findings so the reviewers can refine)

5. **Convergence cap: 3 total `/tp-help` calls** (initial + up to 2 follow-up rounds). If still no convergence after round 3:
   - **Interactive mode**: escalate via `AskUserQuestion` with a summary of the deadlock — Claude's position, reviewers' positions, the specific disagreement, and why Claude cannot reconcile. The user breaks the tie.
   - **Autopilot mode**: document the deadlock in § 1.5 Fix Consensus → "Round 3" entry ("AUTOPILOT DEADLOCK"), then proceed with Claude's best-grounded approach. The deadlock MUST be flagged in the `/fix-next-bug` final session report so the user can audit after the autopilot run ends. Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` (autopilot rule).

6. **Document consensus in the fix section file** (§ 1.5 Fix Consensus, per the template). The content is captured NOW; the file itself is written in Phase 2.

**Interaction with Phase 1.5**: If `/tp-help` reveals the bug is actually systemic (requires architectural change across 4+ files, new abstractions, cross-crate redesign), **return to Phase 1.5** and re-assess. A consensus round that surfaces plan-escalation criteria is a WIN — cheaper than discovering it mid-implementation. Follow Phase 1.5's escalation protocol exactly — including the autopilot exception (which marks `Escalated: requires plan` instead of invoking `/create-plan`).

**Runtime expectation**: `/tp-help` is ~10–15 min per round (dominated by gemini wall time). Budget 10–45 min for Phase 1.75 depending on whether reconciliation rounds are needed. This is deliberately expensive — one saved bad-approach cycle (where tests encode the wrong semantics and the fix has to be reverted) pays for many consensus calls.

### Phase 2: Create the Fix Section File

Create `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md` using the template in [fix-section-template.md](fix-section-template.md). This file is the plan section for this bug fix — it documents the investigation, drives the TDD process, and tracks completion.

**IMPORTANT:** Write the fix file BEFORE writing any code. The fix file is the plan; the plan comes before the implementation.

### Phase 3: TDD — Write Tests First

Follow the TDD discipline from the fix section:

1. **Write all matrix tests** from the fix section's TDD plan
2. **Run them and verify they fail** — if any pass, either the bug is OBE or the test doesn't test what you think
3. **If any test reveals a DIFFERENT bug** (unexpected failure, wrong error message, crash in unrelated code path) — **STOP and invoke `/add-bug`** to file it immediately. Then decide: if it blocks this fix, switch to `/fix-bug` for the new bug first; otherwise continue with the current fix.
4. **Do NOT proceed to implementation until all tests are written and verified failing**

Update the fix section: check off each test as written, note test file paths.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Implement the fix** as described in the fix section
2. **Run the test matrix** — all previously-failing tests should now pass WITHOUT modification
3. If tests need modification after the fix, either the tests were wrong or the fix was wrong — investigate
4. **Run the full suite**: `timeout 150 cargo test --all`
5. **If test-all reveals new failures unrelated to this fix** — invoke `/add-bug` for each one immediately. These are bugs your fix surfaced (interference) or pre-existing bugs you're now seeing. File them, don't ignore them.
6. **Commit via `/commit-push`** — NEVER commit directly with `git commit`. All changes must be committed before review.

Update the fix section: check off implementation tasks, note any discoveries.

### Phase 5: Completion Checklist

Work through the completion checklist in order. **Reviews MUST complete before bug closure** — a bug marked resolved before TPR/hygiene is a premature closure that hides unfinished work from `/fix-next-bug` and `/review-bugs`.

1. **Verify all matrix items** — tests, builds, leak checks
2. **Run `/tpr-review`** — independent third-party review of the fix
3. **Handle TPR findings** — fix any issues found, re-run until clean
4. **Run `/impl-hygiene-review`** — AFTER TPR is clean
5. **Run `/improve-tooling` retrospectively** — MANDATORY at fix close, AFTER both reviews are clean. Bug fixes are the richest source of tooling gaps because you've just spent time fighting the diagnostic surface during root cause analysis. Reflect on: which `diagnostics/` scripts you ran, where you added ad-hoc `dbg!`/`tracing` calls (and what each one was looking for), where the original failure message was unhelpful, where matrix tests were tedious because helpers were missing, what instrumentation would have made the bug obvious in 1 minute instead of 30. Capture every gap you noticed. Implement every accepted improvement NOW (zero deferral) and commit each via SEPARATE `/commit-push` using a valid conventional-commit type (e.g., `build(diagnostics): add --bb-level RC tracking — surfaced by BUG-XX-NNN retrospective` — use `build` for dev/diagnostic scripts, `test` for test-harness, `chore` for general tooling, `ci` for CI, `docs` for tool docs; do NOT use `tools(...)` — the lefthook commit-msg hook rejects any type outside the standard set `feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert`). The retrospective is mandatory even when nothing felt painful — this is exactly when blind spots accumulate. See `.claude/skills/improve-tooling/SKILL.md` "Retrospective Mode" for the full look-back protocol.
6. **Update the bug entry** in the section file — mark `- [x]` with resolution details using the canonical format from `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`
7. **Update the fix section** — set status to `complete`, fill in exit criteria
8. **Update the overview** — adjust open bug count in `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`
9. **Final commit gate** — run `/commit-push` to commit the closure artifacts (bug entry, fix section status, overview count). A fix reported as complete but with uncommitted closure updates creates drift between the tracker and git history.

### Phase 6: Report

Report the fix to the user:
```
Fixed: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
  Fix section: plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md
  Tests added: {count} ({test file paths})
  Files changed: {list}
  Consensus: {converged | converged after N rounds | deadlocked (autopilot — proceeded with Claude's approach)}
  TPR: {passed | findings resolved}
  Hygiene: {passed | findings resolved}
```

## Scaling Rules

### Simple bugs (1-2 files, obvious fix)
- The fix section is still MANDATORY — but sections 1-3 can be brief
- TDD matrix can be smaller if the bug is narrowly scoped — but semantic + negative pins are ALWAYS required
- **TPR and hygiene review are MANDATORY for ALL severities** — per CLAUDE.md Fix Completeness, a fix is not done until `/tpr-review` passed and `/impl-hygiene-review` passed, with no severity carve-out. The investigation/TDD phases scale down for simple bugs; the review gates do not.

### Complex bugs (3+ files, architectural)
- Full investigation with reference compilers
- Multiple design approaches with tradeoffs documented
- TPR checkpoints during implementation if it spans multiple logical steps
- Consider whether the fix belongs in a proper plan section instead of a bug fix

### Clusters (multiple related bugs)
- If 2+ bugs share a root cause, create a single fix section covering all of them
- Name it after the primary bug: `fix-BUG-04-033.md` with the others listed as "Also fixes: BUG-04-034, BUG-04-035"
- The TDD matrix covers ALL bugs in the cluster

## Discovering New Bugs During a Fix — MANDATORY

Fixing a bug often uncovers other bugs. This is expected and valuable. **You MUST invoke `/add-bug` immediately** whenever you encounter a new bug during any phase of this workflow:

- **Phase 1 (Investigation)**: reading adjacent code reveals a different issue
- **Phase 3 (TDD)**: a test exposes an unexpected failure in a different code path
- **Phase 4 (Implementation)**: `test-all.sh` shows new failures unrelated to this fix
- **Phase 5 (Completion)**: TPR or hygiene review surfaces additional issues

Do NOT gloss over these as "not my bug" or "separate issue" — file them via `/add-bug` so they enter the tracker. Then decide: if the new bug **blocks** this fix (interference), shelve this fix and `/fix-bug` the blocker first (per fix-interference rules). If it's independent, continue with the current fix — the new bug is now tracked and will be picked up by `/fix-next-bug` or `/review-bugs`.

## Integration Points

- **`/add-bug`** — invoke during ANY phase when a new bug is discovered. This is the most common integration — fixing bugs surfaces more bugs, and every one must be filed.
- **`/fix-next-bug`** — orchestrates picking bugs from the tracker and invoking this skill in priority order
- **`/review-bugs`** — triages bugs; recommends `/fix-bug` for selected bugs
- **`/create-plan`** — MANDATORY in interactive mode when Phase 1.5 determines the bug needs a plan. In autopilot mode, `/create-plan` is NOT invoked (it requires interactive approval gates) — instead the bug is marked `Escalated: requires plan` per Phase 1.5's autopilot exception.
- **`/commit-push`** — used in Phase 4 to commit changes before review
- **`/tpr-review`** — called during completion checklist
- **`/impl-hygiene-review`** — called during completion checklist, AFTER TPR
