# Fix Bug

Fix a bug with the same rigor as a plan section: investigation, root cause analysis, TDD-first testing, implementation, and full completion checklist including `/tpr-review` and `/impl-hygiene-review`.

## Usage

```
/fix-bug BUG-04-033
/fix-bug BUG-02-005
/fix-bug [description of the bug if ID unknown]
/fix-bug --autopilot BUG-04-033    (called by /fix-next-bug in autopilot mode)
```

## Phase -1: Ground Truth — MANDATORY, EVERY TIME

**Before ANY other work**, re-read the project's CLAUDE.md files to ground yourself in the rules:

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** (project root) — the One Rule, ownership, deferral, TDD, fix completeness, stabilization discipline, coding guidelines, commands
2. **Read `.claude/rules/` files relevant to the bug's subsystem** — always `.claude/rules/tests.md` for test patterns, `.claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md` for SSOT and canonical-home discipline, `.claude/rules/crate-boundaries.md` for crate ownership, and any per-crate rule file under `.claude/rules/oriterm*.md` whose `paths:` glob covers the files being modified

This is NOT optional. Context drift across long sessions causes rule violations. Re-reading ensures every fix follows the same standard regardless of when it runs in a session.

## Autopilot Mode

When invoked with `--autopilot` (by `/fix-next-bug` in autopilot mode), the following rules apply:

- **ZERO user interaction** — do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` for any reason. Make the correct decision yourself based on CLAUDE.md rules and the spec.
- **No pausing, no stopping** — continue through every phase until the bug is fully fixed, reviewed, and committed. No matter the scope. If the correct fix touches 15 files across 4 crates, that IS the fix. Do it.
- **No hacks, no shortcuts, no workarounds** — follow CLAUDE.md's "The One Rule: Correctness Above All" with absolute fidelity. The correct fix is the ONLY fix. Scope, effort, complexity are irrelevant.
- **Full rigor is non-negotiable** — every phase (investigation, TDD matrix, implementation, TPR, hygiene) runs to completion. Autopilot means autonomous, NOT abbreviated.
- **New bugs → `/add-bug`** — file them and keep going. The `/fix-next-bug` loop will pick them up on the next re-scan.
- **Fix interference → handle it** — if a newly discovered bug blocks this fix, **shelve** the current fix, fix the blocker first via a nested `/fix-bug --autopilot`, then resume. "Shelve" means: (1) commit any partial work via `/commit-push` with message `chore(fix-bug): shelve BUG-XX-NNN — blocked by BUG-YY-MMM`, (2) note the WIP commit hash in the fix section file's implementation notes, (3) after the nested fix returns, continue from where you left off — the WIP commit keeps your partial changes safe and separate from the nested fix's commits.
- **Do NOT use `TaskCreate`** — the `/fix-next-bug` autopilot loop maintains a single persistent reminder task. Creating additional tasks would signal work completion and cause the loop to terminate prematurely. Track your progress via the fix section file, not tasks.

When NOT in autopilot mode, `AskUserQuestion` is available as normal for genuinely ambiguous decisions.

## Flaky Tests ARE Bugs — ALWAYS

If a test passes sometimes and fails sometimes, that is a bug — not noise. Do NOT retry and move on. Research the root cause (race condition, timing dependency, temp file collision, state leakage, non-deterministic ordering, filesystem caching) and fix it so the test is deterministic. If discovered during a different bug fix, file via `/add-bug` immediately.

## NEVER Investigate "Pre-existing?" — BANNED

Do NOT use `git checkout`, `git stash`, `git bisect`, `git log --diff-filter`, or any git archaeology to determine whether a bug or test failure existed before your changes. **It does not matter.** The question "was this pre-existing?" is banned. The only valid question is: "is it fixed?"

Spending time checking out old commits to see if something "was already broken" produces zero value. It's broken now → fix it now. No exceptions, no "just to understand the timeline." The timeline is irrelevant. The fix is everything.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Locate the Bug

1. **Find the bug entry** — read the bug-tracker section files to find the bug:
   ```
   plans/bug-tracker/section-{NN}-*.md
   ```
   If the user gave a description instead of an ID, search all section files for a match.

2. **If no bug entry exists yet** — create one now using the `/add-bug` entry format. This is common when a blocking bug is discovered during plan work and goes straight to `/fix-bug`. Write the entry in the appropriate section file before proceeding. Assign the next sequential ID.

3. **Extract context** from the entry: severity, repro, subsystem, source, any notes or cross-refs.

4. **Check for an existing fix file** — if `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md` already exists, resume from where it left off instead of creating a new one.

### Phase 1: Investigation (Research Before Writing)

**Do NOT start coding yet.** Understand the bug first.

1. **Read the affected code** — not just the file listed in the bug entry, but the surrounding context. Understand the data flow, the invariants, and the phase boundaries. Read at least 2-3 files that interact with the buggy code.

2. **Reproduce the bug** — run the repro from the bug entry. If it passes now, the bug may be OBE — follow the OBE exit path below.

   **OBE Exit Path** (bug already fixed by other work):
   1. Verify the fix is real — run the repro AND check that the underlying code path is actually corrected, not just coincidentally passing
   2. Update the bug entry in the section file using the canonical OBE resolution format from `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`:
      ```markdown
      - [x] `[BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}]` **{Short title}**
        Resolved: OBE on {YYYY-MM-DD}. {What fixed it — commit, plan, or rewrite}.
      ```
   3. Update `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md` Quick Reference — decrement the open bug count for this subsystem
   4. Commit via `/commit-push` (the entry update is a deliverable — it must be committed)
   5. **Return OBE outcome** — report to the caller (user or `/fix-next-bug`):
      ```
      OBE: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
        Resolved by: {what fixed it}
        Bug entry updated, overview count decremented.
      ```
   6. **Stop** — do NOT proceed to Phase 1.5 or beyond. The bug is resolved.

3. **Consult the external protocol / reference** — for VT / terminfo / ANSI bugs, check vt100.net, XTerm ctlseqs, ECMA-48, or `man 5 terminfo`. For GPU / wgpu bugs, check the wgpu docs and the reference terminal emulators under `~/projects/reference_repos/console_repos/`. For widget / layout / GUI bugs, check the reference GUI repos under `~/projects/reference_repos/gui_repos/`. The upstream spec / reference implementation is authoritative.

4. **Root cause analysis** — trace the bug to its *root cause*, not just the symptom. Follow the chain:
   - What was observed? (symptom)
   - What code produced this? (proximate cause)
   - Why did that code do the wrong thing? (root cause)
   - Is the root cause localized or systemic? (blast radius)

5. **Check reference implementations** (if the bug involves a design question) — consult `~/projects/reference_repos/console_repos/` (tmux, alacritty, wezterm, ghostty, ratatui, ptyxis, termenv) for prior art on how other terminal emulators handle the same case. For widget / GPU / compositor questions also check `~/projects/reference_repos/gui_repos/` (egui, iced, zed/GPUI, druid, masonry, makepad) and the Chromium UI sparse checkout at `~/projects/reference_repos/chromium_ui/`.

6. **Identify all affected code paths** — the fix may need changes in multiple places. List every file and function that needs to change.

### Phase 1.5: Scope Assessment — MANDATORY GATE

After investigation, assess whether this bug is a **point fix** (inline bug fix) or requires a **plan** (architectural change, cross-system redesign, multi-section work).

#### Severity Reclassification — MANDATORY CHECK

Before scope assessment, **re-evaluate the bug's severity** based on what Phase 1 investigation revealed. The original severity from `/add-bug` was assigned with limited information — now you have root cause analysis, blast radius, and affected code paths.

**Reclassify upward when ANY of these are true:**
- **Blast radius is wider than expected** — the bug affects more code paths, types, or features than the original entry described
- **Root cause is in a complexity-elevated subsystem** (AIMS, CodeGen, LLVM, AOT, Runtime) but severity was rated `medium` or `low` — elevate to at least `high`
- **Silent corruption** — the bug produces wrong results without error/crash (more dangerous than a crash)
- **Cross-crate root cause** — the bug's fix requires changes in 3+ crates, indicating systemic scope
- **Downstream cascade** — fixing this bug would surface or interfere with other known bugs
- **Data loss risk** — the bug could cause incorrect compilation output that goes undetected at runtime

**Reclassify downward when:**
- Investigation reveals the bug is narrower than initially described (affects fewer cases, has natural guardrails)
- The "bug" is actually expected behavior per spec — mark OBE instead of reclassifying

**How to reclassify:**
1. Update the bug entry in `plans/bug-tracker/section-{NN}-*.md` — change the severity tag: `[{old}→{new}]` with a note: `Reclassified {date}: {one-line reason based on Phase 1 findings}`
2. Update the fix section frontmatter `severity:` field (if the fix section already exists from a prior attempt)
3. **Apply the new severity's treatment going forward** — this is the critical part. A bug reclassified from `medium` to `high` now gets mandatory Plan TPR (Phase 2.5). A bug in a complexity-elevated subsystem reclassified from `low` to `high` gets the full elevated treatment. The reclassified severity governs ALL downstream gates.

**The reclassification IS the investigation's deliverable** — it's not bureaucratic overhead. The original severity was a guess; the reclassified severity is informed by root cause analysis. All downstream decisions (Plan TPR gate, scaling rules, review intensity) flow from the *current* severity, not the original.

**In autopilot mode**: reclassify autonomously based on the criteria above. No `AskUserQuestion` needed — the criteria are objective.

#### Scope Assessment

**Point fix criteria** (ALL must be true):
- Root cause is localized to 1-3 files
- Fix does not require redesigning an existing subsystem
- Fix does not span multiple plan sections or roadmap areas
- The "fix approach" can be described in a paragraph, not a document

**Plan escalation criteria** (ANY triggers escalation):
- Root cause is systemic — affects 4+ files across multiple crates/subsystems
- Fix requires architectural change or redesigning an existing system
- Fix involves new abstractions, new pipeline passes, or new data structures
- Fix naturally belongs as a roadmap section or plan with multiple phases
- You cannot write a TDD matrix because the fix approach itself is unclear

**If point fix** → proceed to Phase 1.6 (Create Fix Section File).

**If plan needed** → escalate:
1. **Do NOT proceed to Phase 1.6.** Do NOT write code. Do NOT create a fix section file.
2. **Run `/create-plan`** — create a proper plan for this work. The plan IS the deliverable.
3. **Update the bug entry** in the section file — add a note: `Escalated to plan: plans/{plan-name}/`. Do NOT mark it `[x]` — it is not fixed, it is planned.
4. **Report the escalation** to the user:
   ```
   Escalated: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
     Reason: {why this needs a plan, not an inline fix}
     Plan created: plans/{plan-name}/
     Bug entry updated with plan reference
   ```
5. **Stop.** This bug is done for `/fix-bug`. The plan will be worked separately.

**If blocked/latent** (prerequisite feature doesn't exist yet):
1. **Do NOT proceed to Phase 1.6.** The bug cannot be fixed because the infrastructure doesn't exist.
2. **Update the bug entry** — add a note explaining the blocker: `Blocked: {reason — e.g., "wgpu 24.x does not expose the surface format negotiation hook required to fix this on Windows"}`. Do NOT mark it `[x]`.
3. **Report the blocker:**
   ```
   Blocked: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
     Reason: {what prerequisite is missing}
     Blocker: {roadmap section, plan, or feature that must land first}
     Bug entry updated with blocker reference
   ```
4. **Stop.** This bug is done for `/fix-bug` until the blocker is resolved.

**In autopilot mode**: the same rules apply for ALL non-point-fix outcomes, with one critical exception for `/create-plan`:

- **OBE** → follow the OBE exit path (Phase 1), return OBE outcome to caller
- **Blocked/latent** → update bug entry with `Blocked:` note, return blocked outcome to caller
- **Plan needed** → **do NOT invoke `/create-plan`** (it has mandatory interactive approval gates that conflict with autopilot's zero-interaction contract). Instead:
  1. Update the bug entry with `Escalated: requires plan — {brief reason why inline fix is insufficient}`
  2. Return escalated outcome to caller with the reason
  3. `/fix-next-bug` records this in the session summary; the user creates the plan after the autopilot run

When NOT in autopilot mode, invoke `/create-plan` normally per the escalation protocol above.

Autopilot means autonomous, not reckless. Correctly identifying that a bug needs a plan and deferring the plan creation to the interactive user IS the correct autonomous decision. The key: always return to the caller — never just "document and stop."

### Phase 1.6: Create Fix Section File — IMMEDIATELY After Scope Confirmation

**Create the fix section file NOW** — do NOT wait for `/tp-help` consensus. The fix file is the first user-visible artifact and must exist as soon as the investigation is complete and scope is confirmed.

Create `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md` using the template in [fix-section-template.md](fix-section-template.md). Fill in everything known so far:

- **Frontmatter**: all fields (bug ID, title, severity, status: `in-progress`, goal, subsystem, etc.)
- **§1 Root Cause Analysis**: populated from Phase 1 investigation findings (symptom, proximate cause, root cause, blast radius, affected files)
- **§1.5 Fix Consensus**: leave as `Pending — /tp-help consensus in Phase 1.75`
- **§2 TDD Matrix**: skeleton with section headers — fill in after consensus
- **§2.5 Fix Plan TPR Findings**: leave as gate placeholder — fill in during Phase 2.5 (or mark "Skipped" if gate criteria not met)
- **§3 Implementation**: skeleton with proposed approach from Phase 1 — may be revised by consensus
- **§R TPR Findings**: empty (populated during Phase 5)
- **§4 Completion Checklist**: full template from the fix-section-template

**Why this is here and not later:** The previous workflow created the fix file at Phase 2 (after `/tp-help` consensus), which meant no visible plan artifact existed for potentially 30+ minutes of investigation and consensus work. The user had no way to see progress or verify the investigation findings were being captured. Moving file creation to immediately after scope confirmation ensures:
1. The investigation's root cause analysis is persisted immediately (not held only in Claude's context)
2. The user can read the fix plan and course-correct before `/tp-help` runs
3. If the session is interrupted, the investigation work isn't lost
4. Phase 1.75 (`/tp-help`) updates §1.5 of an existing file rather than creating the whole file from scratch

**Set frontmatter `status: in-progress`** — the fix is now actively being worked, even though implementation hasn't started. The file transitions from `in-progress` to `complete` at Phase 5.

### Phase 1.75: Fix Consensus (via /tp-help) — MANDATORY GATE

**Before writing tests or code, get independent dual-source consensus on the proposed fix approach.** This catches wrong-approach errors BEFORE they are locked into the test matrix or the implementation. The fix section file already exists (Phase 1.6) — this phase fills in its §1.5 Fix Consensus section.

This is NOT `/tp-help`'s usual "stuck help" use case — it is **design consensus**. You have investigation + root cause (Phase 1) + a confirmed point-fix scope (Phase 1.5) + a written fix plan (Phase 1.6) + a proposed approach. You are about to commit to implementation. Get Codex and Gemini to independently pressure-test the approach before you lock it in. The `/tp-help` skill has an explicit carve-out for this calling context (see its "What Does NOT Trigger This" → "Exception — design consensus mode").

**Skip only when:** Phase 1.5 escalated to `/create-plan` or marked blocked. Plans get their own review loops; blocked bugs have nothing to review. EVERY other bug — including "trivial" one-liners — runs through consensus. What looks trivial often has architectural implications you would want flagged.

1. **Articulate the proposed fix** — write out, in prose, for the `/tp-help` question:
   - Bug (one line) + root cause (Phase 1 output)
   - Affected files and what changes in each
   - Your proposed fix approach (what changes, where, why)
   - Alternatives you considered and why you rejected them

2. **Invoke `/tp-help`** with the articulation above as the question. The existing `/tp-help` workflow (dual-source, adversarial framing, mandatory grounding block, worktree guard) runs unchanged — the only difference is the calling context. Save the `$RUN` scratch dir path; you will cite it in § 1.5 of the fix section file.

3. **Independently verify every finding** against actual code per the `feedback_reviewer_grounding_and_trust.md` memory rule. Never trust reviewer claims blindly. Codex = HIGH trust (spot-check key claims), Gemini = LOWER trust (full verification — confabulation-prone). File:line cites are required in § 1.5 "Independent code verification".

4. **Reconcile** into one of three outcomes:
   - **Agreement** — Claude's approach + both reviewers converge → proceed to Phase 2
   - **Persuaded divergence** — reviewers propose a better approach, Claude verifies it against the code and adopts it → proceed to Phase 2 with the new approach
   - **Unpersuaded divergence** — Claude is not convinced by reviewers after code verification → run a follow-up `/tp-help` round with a counter-argument (include the prior round's responses and Claude's specific verification findings so the reviewers can refine)

5. **Convergence cap: 3 total `/tp-help` calls** (initial + up to 2 follow-up rounds). If still no convergence after round 3:
   - **Interactive mode**: escalate via `AskUserQuestion` with a summary of the deadlock — Claude's position, reviewers' positions, the specific disagreement, and why Claude cannot reconcile. The user breaks the tie.
   - **Autopilot mode**: document the deadlock in § 1.5 Fix Consensus → "Round 3" entry ("AUTOPILOT DEADLOCK"), then proceed with Claude's best-grounded approach. The deadlock MUST be flagged in the `/fix-next-bug` final session report so the user can audit after the autopilot run ends. Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` (autopilot rule).

6. **Update the fix section file's §1.5 Fix Consensus** with the consensus outcome (per the template). The fix file already exists from Phase 1.6 — fill in the consensus section now.

**Interaction with Phase 1.5**: If `/tp-help` reveals the bug is actually systemic (requires architectural change across 4+ files, new abstractions, cross-crate redesign), **return to Phase 1.5** and re-assess. A consensus round that surfaces plan-escalation criteria is a WIN — cheaper than discovering it mid-implementation. Follow Phase 1.5's escalation protocol exactly — including the autopilot exception (which marks `Escalated: requires plan` instead of invoking `/create-plan`).

**Runtime expectation**: `/tp-help` is ~10–15 min per round (dominated by gemini wall time). Budget 10–45 min for Phase 1.75 depending on whether reconciliation rounds are needed. This is deliberately expensive — one saved bad-approach cycle (where tests encode the wrong semantics and the fix has to be reverted) pays for many consensus calls.

### Phase 2: Finalize the Fix Section File

The fix section file (`plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md`) already exists from Phase 1.6. After `/tp-help` consensus (Phase 1.75), finalize it:

1. **Update §1.5 Fix Consensus** — already done in Phase 1.75 step 6
2. **Fill in §2 TDD Matrix** — design the test matrix based on the agreed approach. List all tests that will be written in Phase 3.
3. **Fill in §3 Implementation** — write the concrete implementation plan based on the consensus-agreed approach. Include code sketches.
4. **Verify §1 Root Cause Analysis** is still accurate after consensus — if `/tp-help` revealed new affected files or a refined root cause, update §1.

**IMPORTANT:** The fix file must be complete BEFORE writing any code. The file is the plan; the plan comes before the implementation.

### Phase 2.5: Fix Plan TPR — Adversarial Plan Review

**After the fix section is finalized (Phase 2) but BEFORE writing tests or code, run an adversarial `/tpr-review` on the fix PLAN itself.** This is a fundamentally different review from Phase 1.75's `/tp-help` — it stress-tests the plan for edge cases, downstream impacts, and TDD gaps rather than helping converge on an approach.

**Why both `/tp-help` AND Plan TPR exist — they catch different failure classes:**

| Gate | Mode | Catches | Incentive |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| Phase 1.75 `/tp-help` | **Consultative** — "help me find the right approach" | Wrong direction entirely, missed alternatives | Converge to agreement |
| Phase 2.5 Plan TPR | **Adversarial** — "try to break this plan" | Edge cases in TDD matrix, downstream impacts, missed interactions, architectural risks | Find flaws |

A plan that survives collaborative consensus can still have fatal flaws that only surface under adversarial scrutiny. Catching these at the plan stage costs 20-45 min; catching them at Phase 5 (after implementation) costs hours of rework.

#### Trigger Gate: Severity + Subsystem Complexity

Plan TPR is **not always mandatory** — it is gated by bug severity AND subsystem complexity:

**MANDATORY (always run Plan TPR) when ANY of these are true:**
- Bug severity is `critical` or `high`
- Bug is in a **complexity-elevated subsystem** (regardless of severity):

| Subsystem | Crate/Path Pattern | Why Elevated |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **AIMS** | `crates/$1/`, `crates/$1/src/rc/` | 7-dimension lattice, interprocedural fixpoints, pass ordering dependencies, RC invariants |
| **CodeGen** | `crates/$1/src/codegen/` | IR generation touches types, ABI, optimization levels; silent wrong-output bugs |
| **LLVM integration** | `crates/$1/` (broadly) | Debug/release divergence (FastISel vs SelectionDAG), LLVM pass interactions |
| **AOT** | `crates/$1/tests/aot/`, AOT compilation paths | End-to-end: type system → IR → LLVM → linking → runtime; failures can be anywhere in the chain |
| **Runtime** | `crates/$1/` | FFI boundary, RC internals, platform-specific behavior; bugs here corrupt memory silently |

The rationale: these subsystems have inherently high *approach risk* — even a "medium" severity bug (limited user impact) can require a fix with tricky edge cases, deep pass interactions, and non-obvious downstream effects. The severity rating captures *impact*; the subsystem gate captures *fix complexity*. Both dimensions matter.

**SKIP (Plan TPR not required) when ALL of these are true:**
- Bug severity is `medium` or `low`
- Bug is NOT in a complexity-elevated subsystem
- `/tp-help` consensus (Phase 1.75) converged in round 1 with agreement (no divergence)

When skipped, record in the fix section's §2.5: `Plan TPR: Skipped — {severity} severity, non-elevated subsystem, round-1 consensus.`

#### How to Run Plan TPR

1. **Invoke `/tpr-review`** with the fix section file as the review target. The reviewers should examine:
   - §1 Root Cause Analysis — is the root cause correctly identified? Any missed contributing factors?
   - §1.5 Fix Consensus — did consensus miss anything? Are the rejected alternatives truly inferior?
   - §2 TDD Matrix — are there missing cells? Edge cases not covered? Interaction tests missing?
   - §3 Implementation — will this approach actually fix the root cause? What could go wrong? Downstream impacts?

2. **Handle findings** — fix issues in the plan (update TDD matrix, refine implementation approach, add missing edge cases). Re-run Plan TPR if findings were significant (architectural-level concerns, not just missing test cases).

3. **Update §2.5 Plan TPR Findings** in the fix section with the findings and resolutions.

4. **Proceed to Phase 3** only when Plan TPR is clean (no unresolved findings).

**In autopilot mode**: Plan TPR runs the same way — it's non-interactive. If findings require a decision, apply the most correct fix per CLAUDE.md's One Rule.

**Runtime expectation**: ~20–45 min per round (standard `/tpr-review` timing). Budget one round for most bugs; complex bugs with significant findings may need a second round after plan revisions.

### Phase 3: TDD — Write Tests First

Follow the TDD discipline from the fix section:

1. **Write all matrix tests** from the fix section's TDD plan
2. **Run them and verify they fail** — if any pass, either the bug is OBE or the test doesn't test what you think
3. **If any test reveals a DIFFERENT bug** (unexpected failure, wrong error message, crash in unrelated code path) — **STOP and invoke `/add-bug`** to file it immediately. Then decide: if it blocks this fix, switch to `/fix-bug` for the new bug first; otherwise continue with the current fix.
4. **Do NOT proceed to implementation until all tests are written and verified failing**

Update the fix section: check off each test as written, note test file paths.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Implement the fix** as described in the fix section
2. **Run the test matrix** — all previously-failing tests should now pass WITHOUT modification
3. If tests need modification after the fix, either the tests were wrong or the fix was wrong — investigate
4. **Run the full suite**: `timeout 150 cargo test --all`
5. **If test-all reveals new failures unrelated to this fix** — invoke `/add-bug` for each one immediately. These are bugs your fix surfaced (interference) or pre-existing bugs you're now seeing. File them, don't ignore them.
6. **Capability regression check — MANDATORY.** Ask: "Did this fix **disable, remove, or weaken** any existing capability — an optimization, analysis pass, feature, or code path — to achieve soundness?" If YES:
   - The disabled capability MUST have a concrete re-enablement path tracked as a `- [ ]` checkbox in the owning plan (e.g., `plans/repr-opt/`, `plans/perf-engineering/`). If no owning plan exists, create a bug-tracker entry via `/add-bug` with the re-enablement scope.
   - The fix section's §3 Implementation MUST document: (a) what was disabled, (b) why (the soundness argument), (c) the tracked re-enablement item (plan path + section + checkbox text).
   - Any `#[ignore]`'d tests MUST reference the re-enablement item so they are un-ignored when the capability returns.
   - **A fix that disables a capability without tracking re-enablement is a deferral** — it violates CLAUDE.md §Zero Deferral. "Fixed the bug" is not complete when the fix regressed a design goal. The tracking artifact IS part of the fix.
7. **Commit via `/commit-push`** — NEVER commit directly with `git commit`. All changes must be committed before review.

Update the fix section: check off implementation tasks, note any discoveries. **Proceed directly to Phase 5 — do NOT pause, do NOT ask the user for confirmation, do NOT summarize and wait. The commit is mid-workflow, not a stopping point.**

### Phase 5: Completion Checklist

**NO PAUSING** — Phase 5 is a direct continuation of Phase 4. After the Phase 4 commit, proceed immediately into the checklist below. Do NOT prompt the user for confirmation, do NOT ask "should I run the completion checklist?", do NOT pause between items. Every step here is mandatory and autonomous. The `/commit-push` in Phase 4 step 7 is NOT a stopping point — it is mid-workflow.

Work through the completion checklist in order. **Reviews MUST complete before bug closure** — a bug marked resolved before TPR/hygiene is a premature closure that hides unfinished work from `/fix-next-bug` and `/review-bugs`.

**FOREGROUND MANDATORY — ALL nested skill invocations.** When invoking `/tpr-review`, `/impl-hygiene-review`, `/improve-tooling`, `/sync-claude`, or `/commit-push` below, their internal Agent dispatches MUST run in the foreground (do NOT set `run_in_background: true`). The completion checklist is sequential — each step's result informs the next. No independent work to parallelize.

1. **Verify all matrix items** — tests, builds, leak checks as specified in the fix section's completion checklist
2. **Run `/tpr-review`** (Phase 5 — code review) — independent third-party review of the **implementation**. This is distinct from Plan TPR (Phase 2.5) which reviewed the plan. Both TPR phases can surface findings, but they review different artifacts.
3. **Handle code TPR findings** — fix any issues found, re-run until clean
4. **Run `/impl-hygiene-review`** — AFTER code TPR is clean
5. **Run `/improve-tooling` retrospectively** — MANDATORY at fix close, AFTER both reviews are clean. Bug fixes are the richest source of tooling gaps because you've just spent time fighting the diagnostic surface during root cause analysis. Reflect on: which `diagnostics/` scripts you ran, where you added ad-hoc `dbg!`/`tracing` calls (and what each one was looking for), where the original failure message was unhelpful, where matrix tests were tedious because helpers were missing, what instrumentation would have made the bug obvious in 1 minute instead of 30. Capture every gap you noticed. Implement every accepted improvement NOW (zero deferral) and commit each via SEPARATE `/commit-push` using a valid conventional-commit type (e.g., `build(diagnostics): add --bb-level RC tracking — surfaced by BUG-XX-NNN retrospective` — use `build` for dev/diagnostic scripts, `test` for test-harness, `chore` for general tooling, `ci` for CI, `docs` for tool docs; do NOT use `tools(...)` — the lefthook commit-msg hook rejects any type outside the standard set `feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert`). The retrospective is mandatory even when nothing felt painful — this is exactly when blind spots accumulate. See `.claude/skills/improve-tooling/SKILL.md` "Retrospective Mode" for the full look-back protocol.
6. **Capability regression gate** — if Phase 4 step 6 identified a disabled capability, verify BEFORE closure: (a) the re-enablement `- [ ]` item exists in the owning plan, (b) the fix section §3 documents the soundness argument + re-enablement path, (c) any `#[ignore]`'d tests reference the re-enablement item. A fix that closes without these artifacts is incomplete — the regression is untracked.
7. **Update the bug entry** in the section file — mark `- [x]` with resolution details using the canonical format from `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`
8. **Update the fix section** — set status to `complete`, fill in exit criteria
9. **Update the overview** — adjust open bug count in `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`
10. **`/sync-claude` doc sync** — MANDATORY. Bug fixes often touch code paths documented in `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`, or `canon.md`. Run `/sync-claude` to verify all Claude artifacts are consistent with the code changes. Especially critical when the fix: (a) adds/removes/renames a public API, enum variant, or command, (b) changes pipeline phase boundaries or pass ordering, (c) modifies the spec or grammar, (d) touches a subsystem whose rules file (`arc.md`, `codegen-rules.md`, `repr.md`, etc.) describes the affected code path. A fix that changes codegen behavior without updating `codegen-rules.md` is a DRIFT violation waiting to happen.
11. **Final commit gate** — run `/commit-push` to commit the closure artifacts (bug entry, fix section status, overview count, any doc sync updates). A fix reported as complete but with uncommitted closure updates creates drift between the tracker and git history.

### Phase 6: Report

Report the fix to the user:
```
Fixed: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
  Fix section: plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md
  Reclassified: {yes — {old}→{new}: {reason} | no}
  Tests added: {count} ({test file paths})
  Files changed: {list}
  Consensus: {converged | converged after N rounds | deadlocked (autopilot — proceeded with Claude's approach)}
  Plan TPR: {passed | findings resolved | skipped — {reason}}
  Code TPR: {passed | findings resolved}
  Hygiene: {passed | findings resolved}
```

## Scaling Rules

### Simple bugs (1-2 files, obvious fix, non-elevated subsystem)
- The fix section is still MANDATORY — but sections 1-3 can be brief
- TDD matrix can be smaller if the bug is narrowly scoped — but semantic + negative pins are ALWAYS required
- **Plan TPR (Phase 2.5) may be SKIPPED** — only when: severity is medium/low AND subsystem is not complexity-elevated AND `/tp-help` converged in round 1. See Phase 2.5 gate criteria.
- **Code TPR (Phase 5) and hygiene review are MANDATORY for ALL severities** — per CLAUDE.md Fix Completeness, a fix is not done until `/tpr-review` passed and `/impl-hygiene-review` passed, with no severity carve-out. The investigation/TDD phases scale down for simple bugs; the Phase 5 review gates do not.

### Complex bugs (3+ files, architectural, or complexity-elevated subsystem)
- Full investigation with reference terminal emulators and GUI frameworks
- Multiple design approaches with tradeoffs documented
- **Severity reclassification at Phase 1.5** — investigation often reveals the bug is worse than initially rated. Reclassify upward when blast radius, subsystem complexity, or silent corruption risk warrants it. The reclassified severity governs all downstream gates.
- **Plan TPR (Phase 2.5) is MANDATORY** — complexity-elevated subsystems always trigger it; critical/high severity always triggers it
- Code TPR (Phase 5) checkpoints during implementation if it spans multiple logical steps
- Consider whether the fix belongs in a proper plan section instead of a bug fix

### Clusters (multiple related bugs)
- If 2+ bugs share a root cause, create a single fix section covering all of them
- Name it after the primary bug: `fix-BUG-04-033.md` with the others listed as "Also fixes: BUG-04-034, BUG-04-035"
- The TDD matrix covers ALL bugs in the cluster

## Discovering New Bugs During a Fix — MANDATORY

Fixing a bug often uncovers other bugs. This is expected and valuable. **You MUST invoke `/add-bug` immediately** whenever you encounter a new bug during any phase of this workflow:

- **Phase 1 (Investigation)**: reading adjacent code reveals a different issue
- **Phase 3 (TDD)**: a test exposes an unexpected failure in a different code path
- **Phase 4 (Implementation)**: `test-all.sh` shows new failures unrelated to this fix
- **Phase 5 (Completion)**: TPR or hygiene review surfaces additional issues

Do NOT gloss over these as "not my bug" or "separate issue" — file them via `/add-bug` so they enter the tracker. Then decide: if the new bug **blocks** this fix (interference), shelve this fix and `/fix-bug` the blocker first (per fix-interference rules). If it's independent, continue with the current fix — the new bug is now tracked and will be picked up by `/fix-next-bug` or `/review-bugs`.

## Integration Points

- **`/add-bug`** — invoke during ANY phase when a new bug is discovered. This is the most common integration — fixing bugs surfaces more bugs, and every one must be filed.
- **`/fix-next-bug`** — orchestrates picking bugs from the tracker and invoking this skill in priority order
- **`/review-bugs`** — triages bugs; recommends `/fix-bug` for selected bugs
- **`/create-plan`** — MANDATORY in interactive mode when Phase 1.5 determines the bug needs a plan. In autopilot mode, `/create-plan` is NOT invoked (it requires interactive approval gates) — instead the bug is marked `Escalated: requires plan` per Phase 1.5's autopilot exception.
- **`/tp-help`** — called in Phase 1.75 for consultative design consensus before tests/implementation
- **`/tpr-review`** — called in **two distinct phases**: Phase 2.5 (adversarial plan review — gated by severity + subsystem complexity) and Phase 5 (adversarial code review — mandatory for ALL severities). These are different review targets: plan vs. implementation.
- **`/commit-push`** — used in Phase 4 to commit changes before review
- **`/impl-hygiene-review`** — called during Phase 5 completion checklist, AFTER code TPR
- **`/improve-tooling`** — called during Phase 5 completion checklist, AFTER both reviews are clean
