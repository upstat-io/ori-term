# Fix Bug

Fix a bug with the same rigor as a plan section: investigation, root cause analysis, TDD-first testing, implementation, and full completion checklist including `/tpr-review` and `/impl-hygiene-review`.

## Usage

```
/fix-bug BUG-04-033
/fix-bug BUG-02-005
/fix-bug [description of the bug if ID unknown]
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Locate the Bug

1. **Find the bug entry** — read the bug-tracker section files to find the bug:
   ```
   plans/bug-tracker/section-{NN}-*.md
   ```
   If the user gave a description instead of an ID, search all section files for a match.

2. **If no bug entry exists yet** — create one now using the `/add-bug` entry format. This is common when a blocking bug is discovered during plan work and goes straight to `/fix-bug`. Write the entry in the appropriate section file before proceeding. Assign the next sequential ID.

3. **Extract context** from the entry: severity, repro, subsystem, source, any notes or cross-refs.

4. **Check for an existing fix file** — if `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-XX-NNN.md` already exists, resume from where it left off instead of creating a new one.

### Phase 1: Investigation (Research Before Writing)

**Do NOT start coding yet.** Understand the bug first.

1. **Read the affected code** — not just the file listed in the bug entry, but the surrounding context. Understand the data flow, the invariants, and the crate boundaries. Read at least 2-3 files that interact with the buggy code.

2. **Reproduce the bug** ��� run the repro from the bug entry. If it passes now, the bug may be OBE — verify and mark resolved if so.

3. **Root cause analysis** — trace the bug to its *root cause*, not just the symptom. Follow the chain:
   - What was observed? (symptom)
   - What code produced this? (proximate cause)
   - Why did that code do the wrong thing? (root cause)
   - Is the root cause localized or systemic? (blast radius)

4. **Check reference repos** (if the bug involves a design question) — consult `~/projects/reference_repos/console_repos/` for prior art on how other terminal emulators handle this case.

5. **Identify all affected code paths** — the fix may need changes in multiple places. List every file and function that needs to change.

### Phase 2: Create the Fix Section File

Create `plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md` using the template in [fix-section-template.md](fix-section-template.md). This file is the plan section for this bug fix — it documents the investigation, drives the TDD process, and tracks completion.

**IMPORTANT:** Write the fix file BEFORE writing any code. The fix file is the plan; the plan comes before the implementation.

### Phase 3: TDD — Write Tests First

Follow the TDD discipline from the fix section:

1. **Write all matrix tests** from the fix section's TDD plan
2. **Run them and verify they fail** — if any pass, either the bug is OBE or the test doesn't test what you think
3. **Do NOT proceed to implementation until all tests are written and verified failing**

Update the fix section: check off each test as written, note test file paths.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Implement the fix** as described in the fix section
2. **Run the test matrix** — all previously-failing tests should now pass WITHOUT modification
3. If tests need modification after the fix, either the tests were wrong or the fix was wrong — investigate
4. **Run the full suite**: `timeout 150 ./test-all.sh`
5. **Commit via `/commit-push`** — NEVER commit directly with `git commit`. All changes must be committed before review.

Update the fix section: check off implementation tasks, note any discoveries.

### Phase 5: Completion Checklist

Work through the completion checklist in order:

1. **Verify all matrix items** — tests, builds
2. **Update the bug entry** in the section file — mark `- [x]` with resolution details
3. **Update the fix section** — set status to `complete`, fill in exit criteria
4. **Update the overview** — adjust open bug count
5. **Run `/tpr-review`** — independent third-party review of the fix
6. **Handle TPR findings** — fix any issues found, re-run if needed
7. **Run `/impl-hygiene-review last commit`** — AFTER TPR is clean

### Phase 6: Report

Report the fix to the user:
```
Fixed: [BUG-{section}-{ordinal}][{severity}] {title}
  Fix section: plans/bug-tracker/fix-BUG-{section}-{ordinal}.md
  Tests added: {count} ({test file paths})
  Files changed: {list}
  TPR: {passed | findings resolved}
  Hygiene: {passed | findings resolved}
```

## Scaling Rules

### Simple bugs (1-2 files, obvious fix)
- The fix section is still MANDATORY — but sections 1-3 can be brief
- TDD matrix can be smaller if the bug is narrowly scoped — but semantic + negative pins are ALWAYS required
- Completion checklist is NEVER shortened for critical/high severity
- For medium severity: TPR expected, hygiene recommended
- For low severity: TPR + hygiene recommended but not required — document if skipped

### Complex bugs (3+ files, architectural)
- Full investigation with reference repos
- Multiple design approaches with tradeoffs documented
- TPR checkpoints during implementation if it spans multiple logical steps
- Consider whether the fix belongs in a proper plan section instead of a bug fix

### Clusters (multiple related bugs)
- If 2+ bugs share a root cause, create a single fix section covering all of them
- Name it after the primary bug: `fix-BUG-04-033.md` with the others listed as "Also fixes: BUG-04-034, BUG-04-035"
- The TDD matrix covers ALL bugs in the cluster

## Integration Points

- **`/add-bug`** — files bugs; references `/fix-bug` for when they're picked up
- **`/review-bugs`** — triages bugs; recommends `/fix-bug` for selected bugs
- **`/create-plan`** — for bugs that turn out to need architectural change, escalate to a proper plan
- **`/commit-push`** — used in Phase 4 to commit changes before review
- **`/tpr-review`** — called during completion checklist
- **`/impl-hygiene-review`** — called during completion checklist, AFTER TPR
