# Fix: BUG-{section}-{ordinal} — {Title}

**Status:** Not Started
**Severity:** {severity}
**Goal:** {Expanded goal — what must be true when this fix is complete.}

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] {Criterion — specific behavioral outcome with verification method}
- [ ] {Criterion — test name, command, or observable result}

**Context:** {Why this bug exists. What pain point it causes. How it was discovered.
Cite the original bug entry. 2-4 sentences.}

---

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

- **Symptom**: {What was observed — error message, wrong output, crash}
- **Proximate cause**: {What code produced the wrong behavior}
- **Root cause**: {Why that code does the wrong thing — the architectural/logical flaw}
- **Blast radius**: {What else is affected — other tests, features, code paths}
- **Affected files**:
  - `{file1}` — {what needs to change and why}
  - `{file2}` — {what needs to change and why}

**Reference implementations** (if applicable):
- **{Language}** `{file path}`: {How they handle this case}

---

## 1.5 Fix Consensus (via /tp-help)

Independent dual-source design review of the proposed fix approach. Ran BEFORE tests or implementation to catch wrong-approach errors before they lock in. See `.claude/skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md` § Phase 1.75 for the calling contract.

- **Proposed approach (pre-consensus)**: {Claude's initial plan before tp-help — what would have been written into § 3 Implementation if consensus had been skipped}
- **tp-help run scratch dir**: `{$RUN path}`

### Round 1
- **Codex summary**: {brief summary of codex's response — key agreements and disagreements}
- **Gemini summary**: {brief summary of gemini's response — key agreements and disagreements}
- **Agreement points**: {where Claude + both reviewers converge}
- **Disagreement points**: {where they diverge from Claude's proposal or from each other}
- **Independent code verification**: {what Claude checked against actual code — file:line cites for each verified/refuted finding}
- **Outcome**: {agreement → proceed | persuaded divergence → proceed with revised approach | unpersuaded divergence → round 2}

### Round 2 *(if round 1 outcome was "unpersuaded divergence")*
- **Follow-up question**: {the counter-argument or clarification Claude sent}
- **Codex response summary**: {…}
- **Gemini response summary**: {…}
- **Independent code verification**: {file:line cites}
- **Outcome**: {agreement | persuaded divergence | unpersuaded divergence → round 3}

### Round 3 *(hard cap — if round 2 outcome was "unpersuaded divergence")*
- **Follow-up question**: {…}
- **Codex response summary**: {…}
- **Gemini response summary**: {…}
- **Independent code verification**: {file:line cites}
- **Outcome**: {agreement | persuaded divergence | deadlock}

### Final agreed approach
{The fix approach that will be implemented in § 3 — either the original proposal, a persuaded-divergence revision, or (autopilot deadlock only) Claude's best-grounded approach. Must be concrete enough that § 2 TDD matrix and § 3 Implementation can be written directly from it.}

{**If autopilot deadlock**: explicitly state "AUTOPILOT DEADLOCK" here. Include Claude's grounding for the chosen approach (which reviewer's critiques were addressed, which were deemed incorrect after code verification, and the residual uncertainty). /fix-next-bug's final session report will flag this bug for user audit.}

---

## 2. TDD — Test Matrix

Write ALL tests BEFORE the fix. Verify they fail against current code.

### Exact failing case
- [ ] {The specific input that triggered the bug — from the repro}

### Edge cases
- [ ] {Empty, single-element, boundary conditions relevant to this bug}
- [ ] {Additional edge cases}

### Cross-type coverage (if type-dependent)
- [ ] {Test with str}
- [ ] {Test with [int]}
- [ ] {Test with Option<T>}
- [ ] {Test with structs, closures, maps, sets as applicable}

### Cross-pattern coverage (if pattern-dependent)
- [ ] {Test each relevant control-flow pattern}

### Cross-feature interactions
- [ ] {Test interaction with closures, generics, ?, pattern matching, traits as applicable}

### Semantic pin
- [ ] {Test that ONLY passes with the correct/new semantics — the permanent regression guard}

### Negative pin
- [ ] {Test that REJECTS the old/broken behavior — proves the code actively prevents regression}

### Verify tests fail before fix
- [ ] All new tests fail against current code (confirming they test the right thing)

## 2.5 Fix Plan TPR Findings

Adversarial review of this fix PLAN (§1–§3) before implementation. Ran AFTER `/tp-help` consensus (§1.5) and plan finalization (§2) but BEFORE writing tests or code. Reviews the root cause analysis, TDD matrix completeness, and implementation approach for edge cases, downstream impacts, and architectural risks.

**Gate:** {Mandatory — severity is critical/high | Mandatory — complexity-elevated subsystem ({subsystem}) | Skipped — {severity} severity, non-elevated subsystem, round-1 consensus}

{If mandatory and ran:}
- **TPR run**: {date, scratch dir or run reference}
- **Key findings**: {numbered list of findings with resolution status}
- **Plan revisions**: {what changed in §2 TDD Matrix or §3 Implementation as a result}
- **Outcome**: {clean | findings resolved — proceed to Phase 3}

{If skipped:}
Plan TPR: Skipped — {severity} severity, non-elevated subsystem, round-1 consensus.

---

## 3. Implementation

- [ ] {Describe the fix approach — what changes, where, why}
  ```rust
  // Code sketch showing the target fix (types, signatures, key logic)
  ```
- [ ] {Additional implementation steps if multi-file}
- [ ] {Any co-implementation requirements with other subsystems}

---

## R. Third Party Review Findings

TPR findings raised against this fix are recorded here by the executor (Claude) during Phase 5. When `/tpr-review` produces findings related to this bug fix, the executor transcribes them into this block using the standard reviewer-tagged format (e.g. `[TPR-XX-001-codex]`). This block is the permanent TPR audit trail for this fix — it stays with the fix section even after resolution.

{Initially empty — populated by the executor during Phase 5 completion checklist.}

## 4. Completion Checklist

Reviews MUST complete before bug closure — a bug marked resolved before TPR/hygiene is a premature closure.

- [ ] All new tests pass unchanged after fix (no test modifications needed)
- [ ] Matrix completeness verified — every cell in type × pattern × feature × platform grid has a test
- [ ] Debug AND release builds pass (`cargo b && cargo b --release`)
- [ ] Windows cross-compile green (`cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)
- [ ] If the fix touches the GPU render path, visual-regression suite under `oriterm/src/gpu/visual_regression/` green (cached path via `render_frame_cached`)
- [ ] If the fix touches the hot render path, `oriterm_core/tests/alloc_regression.rs` and `rss_regression.rs` still green (performance invariants preserved)
- [ ] `timeout 150 ./test-all.sh` green — no regressions
- [ ] `./clippy-all.sh` green
- [ ] `./build-all.sh` green (workspace + cross-compile)
- [ ] `cargo test -p {affected_crate}` green
- [ ] `/commit-push` — commit all changes before review
- [ ] Plan TPR (Phase 2.5) — {completed | skipped — reason}. See §2.5 above.
- [ ] `/tpr-review` (Phase 5 — code review) passed — independent dual-source review of the IMPLEMENTATION found no actionable findings. **MANDATORY for ALL severities** — per CLAUDE.md "NO WORKAROUNDS" and the Bug Discipline rigor rule, no severity carve-out. This is distinct from Plan TPR (Phase 2.5) which reviews the plan before implementation.
- [ ] `/impl-hygiene-review` passed — MUST run AFTER code `/tpr-review` is clean. **MANDATORY for ALL severities.**
- [ ] **Capability regression gate** — if the fix disabled, removed, or weakened any capability (feature, render path, widget, protocol support): (a) re-enablement `- [ ]` item exists in the owning plan, (b) §3 Implementation documents soundness argument + re-enablement path, (c) `#[ignore]`'d tests reference the re-enablement item. Skip if the fix did not regress any capability.
- [ ] `/improve-tooling` retrospective completed — MANDATORY at fix close, after both reviews are clean. Reflect on the bug-finding journey: which test harness / script / diagnostic you ran during root cause analysis, where you added ad-hoc `log::debug!`/`tracing` calls (and what each one was looking for), where the original failure message was unhelpful, where the matrix tests were tedious because helpers were missing, what instrumentation would have made the bug obvious in 1 minute instead of 30. Bug fixes are the richest source of tooling gaps because you've just spent time fighting the diagnostic surface — capture every gap. Implement every accepted improvement NOW (zero deferral) and commit each via SEPARATE `/commit-push` using a valid conventional-commit type (e.g., `test(teseq): surface missing `reseq` binary in skip message — surfaced by BUG-XX-NNN retrospective` — `build`/`test`/`chore`/`ci`/`docs` are the valid types; do NOT use `tools(...)`, the lefthook commit-msg hook rejects it). See `.claude/skills/improve-tooling/SKILL.md` "Retrospective Mode" for the full look-back protocol.
- [ ] Bug entry in `plans/bug-tracker/section-{NN}-*.md` updated: `- [x]` with resolution details (canonical format from `plans/bug-tracker/00-overview.md`)
- [ ] Fix section frontmatter `status` updated to `complete`
- [ ] Bug-tracker `00-overview.md` Quick Reference open bug count updated
- [ ] Final `/commit-push` — commit closure artifacts (bug entry, fix section status, overview count)

**Exit Criteria:** {Paragraph describing the measurable, testable condition
that proves this fix is complete. Include specific test names, commands,
and what output they produce. Not "X works" but "X produces Y output
when Z command is run, with 0 regressions across the full test suite."}
```
