#
# Retry policy:
#   - 3 attempts per reviewer per round
#   - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s between attempts
#   - Retries are SEPARATE from the wrapper's semantic iteration budget
#   - On failure: returns the failure category as the last line of stderr,
#     leaves $RUN intact for postmortem, exits 1

# Success criteria (all must hold):
#   - dual-invoke.sh exits 0 (both reviewers exited cleanly)
#   - parse-codex.py succeeds on $RUN/codex.jsonl
#   - parse-gemini.py succeeds on $RUN/gemini.jsonl
#   - worktree-guard.sh compare passes (no dirty files)

# is_terminal_failure: classify a failure category as either terminal (no
# retry) or retryable (worth another attempt). Returns 0 (true) for terminal,
# 1 (false) for retryable.
#
# The failure category is formed by `dual-invoke-with-retry.sh` as either
# `launch_or_exit_fail` (dual-invoke.sh exited non-zero, meaning one or both
# reviewer subprocesses failed to run cleanly), or `<reviewer>_<first-stderr-
# line>` where <first-stderr-line> is the authoritative failure category
# emitted by `parse-codex.py` or `parse-gemini.py`. This classifier must stay
# in sync with the parsers' emitted category list — the canonical source is:
#
#   parse-codex.py:  missing_dependency | missing_envelope | parse_fail |
#                    schema_violation | failed_partial
#   parse-gemini.py: missing_dependency | missing_envelope | missing_terminator |
#                    missing_begin_sentinel | missing_end_sentinel |
#                    missing_json_block | parse_fail | schema_violation |
#                    failed_partial
#
# Terminal categories — deterministic, retry will produce the same result:
#
#   dirty_worktree                 — reviewer modified tracked files, will do
#                                    so again on retry (BUG-08-002 fix).
#   codex_missing_dependency       — jsonschema Python module not installed
#                                    on this host; won't install itself on
#                                    retry (TPR-04-002-codex fix).
#   codex_missing_envelope         — codex exited 0 but emitted no agent
#                                    message; the skill or prompt is broken.
#   codex_schema_violation         — codex emitted JSON that violates the
#                                    envelope schema; model/prompt issue.
#   codex_failed_partial           — envelope valid but status=failed_partial;
#                                    reviewer explicitly said it did not
#                                    finish — retry won't change that.
#   gemini_missing_dependency      — same as codex (env issue).
#   gemini_missing_envelope        — gemini exited 0 but emitted no assistant
#                                    message; the skill is broken.
#   gemini_missing_json_block      — sentinels present but no fenced JSON
#                                    block between them; skill output format
#                                    is broken.
#   gemini_failed_partial          — same as codex.
#
# Retryable categories — could be transient, worth another attempt:
#
#   gemini_schema_violation        — gemini emitted JSON that fails schema
#                                    validation even after the repair layer
#                                    (repair_envelope.py) attempted to fix
#                                    common violations. Previously terminal,
#                                    reclassified as retryable because a fresh
#                                    gemini invocation may produce different
#                                    output that IS repairable. The 3-attempt
#                                    budget bounds the cost for systematic
#                                    failures. Codex schema_violation remains
#                                    terminal because codex's JSON compliance
#                                    is more reliable.
#   launch_or_exit_fail            — dual-invoke.sh returned non-zero. This
#                                    collapses ALL launch-time failures into
#                                    one category because dual-invoke.sh
#                                    discards reviewer stderr (`2>/dev/null`).
#                                    We cannot distinguish a deterministic
#                                    OpenAI 400 schema rejection from a
#                                    transient network failure at this layer,
#                                    so we retry. The 3-attempt budget bounds
#                                    the waste for deterministic cases.
#   codex_parse_fail               — codex emitted text that isn't JSON.
#                                    Could be mid-stream truncation (transient)
#                                    or a model output bug (deterministic).
#                                    Retry to distinguish.
#   gemini_parse_fail              — same as codex_parse_fail.
#   gemini_missing_terminator      — assistant content present but no
#                                    result/success event; could be a
#                                    cancelled stream (transient).
#   gemini_missing_begin_sentinel  — no BEGIN sentinel AND sentinel-less
#                                    fallback found no fenced JSON block
#                                    matching the review-envelope shape.
#                                    Previously terminal on the theory that
#                                    this indicated skill misconfiguration,
#                                    but the real-world pattern is gemini
#                                    cutting off mid-emission after saying
#                                    "I'm ready to emit the envelope" and
#                                    never actually writing the fenced block
#                                    (ori-tpr-ODwpfyOd failure class). A
#                                    fresh gemini invocation has a real
#                                    chance of completing the emission, so
#                                    retry is load-bearing. Symmetric with
#                                    missing_end_sentinel (truncation inside
#                                    the envelope) and missing_terminator
#                                    (no result event) — all three failure
#                                    modes share a "gemini output was cut
#                                    short" root cause and all should retry.
#   gemini_missing_end_sentinel    — BEGIN found but END missing; could be
#                                    truncation (transient).
#   unknown_failure                — fall back to retry; if it's deterministic
#                                    the retry will surface the same category
#                                    three times and the operator will see it.
#
# Why this is the symmetric form of BUG-08-002: the dirty_worktree fix added
# a single-case `break`. This generalizes that to a classifier so we don't
# burn 3 attempts on every newly-discovered deterministic failure mode. The
# categories listed above are the RESULT of auditing what parse-codex.py and
# parse-gemini.py actually emit — earlier iterations of this function
# invented category names (`codex_invalid_*`, `codex_authentication_*`,
# `gemini_authentication_*`, `gemini_no_begin`) that were never produced by
# any code path and therefore had no effect. That was a SSOT violation per
# impl-hygiene.md (classifier encoded drifted knowledge about parser output
# instead of matching the actual parser emissions). TPR-04-001-codex.
