# Usage: same args as dual-invoke.sh
#
# Retry policy:
#   - 5 attempts per reviewer per round (was 3; raised for capacity errors)
#   - Default backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 30s, 60s between attempts
#   - Capacity-aware backoff: 30s, 60s, 120s, 120s, 120s for API capacity errors
#   - Retries are SEPARATE from the wrapper's semantic iteration budget
#   - On failure: returns the failure category as the last line of stderr,
#     leaves $RUN intact for postmortem, exits 1
#
# Success criteria (all must hold):
#   - dual-invoke.sh exits 0 (both reviewers exited cleanly)
#   - parse-codex.py succeeds on $RUN/codex.jsonl
#   - parse-gemini.py succeeds on $RUN/gemini.jsonl
#
# Worktree drift check (informational, non-blocking by default):
#   - worktree-guard.sh compare runs AFTER parsers succeed
#   - Drift is logged as a WARNING, not a failure — the user regularly runs
#     parallel agents and their edits should not kill the review round
#   - Only escalated to terminal failure with ORI_TPR_STRICT_WORKTREE=1
#   - Drift details saved to $RUN/worktree-drift.txt for user triage

# is_terminal_failure: classify a failure category as either terminal (no
# retry) or retryable (worth another attempt). Returns 0 (true) for terminal,
# 1 (false) for retryable.
#
# The failure category is formed by `dual-invoke-with-retry.sh` as either
# `launch_or_exit_fail` (dual-invoke.sh exited non-zero, meaning one or both
# reviewer subprocesses failed to run cleanly), or `<reviewer>_<first-stderr-
# line>` where <first-stderr-line> is the authoritative failure category
# emitted by `parse-codex.py` or `parse-gemini.py`. This classifier must stay
# in sync with the parsers' emitted category list — the canonical source is:
#
#   parse-codex.py:  missing_dependency | missing_envelope | parse_fail |
#                    schema_violation | failed_partial
#   parse-gemini.py: missing_dependency | missing_envelope | missing_terminator |
#                    missing_begin_sentinel | missing_end_sentinel |
#                    missing_json_block | parse_fail | schema_violation |
#                    failed_partial
#
# Terminal categories — deterministic, retry will produce the same result:
#
#   dirty_worktree                 — tracked-file drift detected AND
#                                    ORI_TPR_STRICT_WORKTREE=1 was set.
#                                    Without strict mode, drift is a non-
#                                    blocking warning (not a failure at all).
#                                    (Post-2026-04-12: default changed from

#                                    parallel agents whose edits are expected).
#   codex_missing_dependency       — jsonschema Python module not installed
#                                    on this host; won't install itself on
#                                    retry (TPR-04-002-codex fix).
#   codex_missing_envelope         — codex exited 0 but emitted no agent
#                                    message; the skill or prompt is broken.
#   codex_schema_violation         — codex emitted JSON that violates the
#                                    envelope schema; model/prompt issue.
#   codex_failed_partial           — envelope valid but status=failed_partial;
#                                    reviewer explicitly said it did not
#                                    finish — retry won't change that.
#   gemini_missing_dependency      — same as codex (env issue).
#   gemini_missing_envelope        — gemini exited 0 but emitted no assistant
#                                    message; the skill is broken.
#   gemini_missing_json_block      — sentinels present but no fenced JSON
#                                    block between them; skill output format
#                                    is broken.
#   gemini_failed_partial          — same as codex.
#
# Retryable categories — could be transient, worth another attempt:
#
#   gemini_schema_violation        — [EFFECTIVELY DEAD CODE as of 2026-04-13]
#                                    parse-gemini.py now RESCUES schema-invalid
#                                    envelopes (exits 0 with RESCUED warnings)
#                                    instead of emitting this category. Kept in
#                                    the classifier as a safety net in case a
#                                    future parser change re-introduces it.
#   launch_or_exit_fail            — dual-invoke.sh returned non-zero. This
#                                    collapses ALL launch-time failures into
#                                    one category because dual-invoke.sh
#                                    discards reviewer stderr (`2>/dev/null`).
#                                    We cannot distinguish a deterministic
#                                    OpenAI 400 schema rejection from a
#                                    transient network failure at this layer,
#                                    so we retry. The 3-attempt budget bounds
#                                    the waste for deterministic cases.
#   codex_parse_fail               — codex emitted text that isn't JSON.
#                                    Could be mid-stream truncation (transient)
#                                    or a model output bug (deterministic).
#                                    Retry to distinguish.
#   gemini_parse_fail              — same as codex_parse_fail.
#   gemini_missing_terminator      — assistant content present but no
#                                    result/success event; could be a
#                                    cancelled stream (transient).
#   gemini_missing_begin_sentinel  — no BEGIN sentinel AND sentinel-less
#                                    fallback found no fenced JSON block
#                                    matching the review-envelope shape.
#                                    Previously terminal on the theory that
#                                    this indicated skill misconfiguration,
#                                    but the real-world pattern is gemini
#                                    cutting off mid-emission after saying
#                                    "I'm ready to emit the envelope" and
#                                    never actually writing the fenced block
#                                    (ori-tpr-ODwpfyOd failure class). A
#                                    fresh gemini invocation has a real
#                                    chance of completing the emission, so
#                                    retry is load-bearing. Symmetric with
#                                    missing_end_sentinel (truncation inside
#                                    the envelope) and missing_terminator
#                                    (no result event) — all three failure
#                                    modes share a "gemini output was cut
#                                    short" root cause and all should retry.
#   gemini_missing_end_sentinel    — BEGIN found but END missing; could be
#                                    truncation (transient).
#   unknown_failure                — fall back to retry; if it's deterministic
#                                    the retry will surface the same category
#                                    three times and the operator will see it.
#
# Why this is the symmetric form of the original dirty_worktree fix: the
# original fix added a single-case `break`. This generalizes that to a
# classifier so we don't burn 3 attempts on deterministic failure modes. The
# categories listed above are the RESULT of auditing what parse-codex.py and
# parse-gemini.py actually emit — earlier iterations of this function
# invented category names (`codex_invalid_*`, `codex_authentication_*`,
# `gemini_authentication_*`, `gemini_no_begin`) that were never produced by
# any code path and therefore had no effect. That was a SSOT violation per
# impl-hygiene.md (classifier encoded drifted knowledge about parser output
# instead of matching the actual parser emissions). TPR-04-001-codex.
