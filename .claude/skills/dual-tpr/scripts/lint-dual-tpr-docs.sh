# lint-dual-tpr-docs.sh — verify dual-TPR documentation invariants.
#
# Lints the dual-TPR documentation files (transport.md + both gemini
# SKILL.md files + the tpr-review wrapper) for two classes of bug
# that both landed in the dual-tpr-gemini/section-03.3 work product
# before self-review caught them:
#
#   (1) Internal path references must resolve. Any `.claude/...` or
#       `.gemini/...` path mentioned in one of the linted docs MUST
#       point to a file that actually exists on disk. This catches
#       typos like `.claee/skills/dual-tpr/findings-schema.json`
#       (single-letter drop in "claude") that would propagate to
#       every future wrapper copying the template.
#
#   (2) Required literal phrases must be present. Some checks in the
#       plan require specific strings to appear verbatim in the docs
#       (e.g., both `Activate the review-work skill` and
#       `Activate the review-plan skill` must appear in transport.md).
#       Prose instructions like "substitute as appropriate" do NOT
#       satisfy these checks. This rule catches the gap where a
#       template author wrote substitution instructions in English
#       instead of both literal strings.
#
# This lint is a peer to `lint-command-file.sh`, not a replacement
# for it. command-file.md has a tightly-scoped contract
# (reviewer-agnostic + 6 methodology concepts) that deserves its own
# single-purpose lint. This umbrella lint owns the remaining dual-TPR
# surface: transport.md + both gemini SKILL.md files.
#
# Usage:
#   lint-dual-tpr-docs.sh              # lint the canonical dual-TPR docs
#
# Exits 0 if all checks pass, 1 if any lint fails, 2 on usage error.
