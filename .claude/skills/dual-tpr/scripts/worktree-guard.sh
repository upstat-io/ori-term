# worktree-guard.sh — snapshot or compare git working tree state.
#
# Purpose: detect reviewer-caused modifications to the working tree during a
# dual-source review run. Reviewers (codex, gemini) run under prompt-discipline
# contracts that forbid writing to tracked files; this script's `compare` mode
# exists to catch violations.
#
# CORRECT SEMANTICS (post-2026-04-08 fix): `compare` flags ONLY lines that are
# new in AFTER that weren't in BEFORE. A line that was in BEFORE and is now
# absent in AFTER means the drift was CLEANED UP during the run (e.g., Claude
# committed pre-existing uncommitted edits) — that is NOT a violation and
# MUST NOT trigger the guard. The prior implementation used `diff -q` which
# flagged ANY difference in either direction, producing false positives when
# the worktree went dirty → clean during the run. Surfaced empirically during
# plans/dual-tpr-gemini §07.3 Scenario 1 execution on 2026-04-08.
#
# Usage:
#   worktree-guard.sh snapshot OUT_FILE
#     Saves `git status --porcelain` to OUT_FILE.
#
#   worktree-guard.sh compare BEFORE_FILE [SAVE_AFTER_FILE]
#     Compares current `git status --porcelain` to BEFORE_FILE, flagging only
#     NEW drift (lines in AFTER not present in BEFORE). Exit 0 if no new drift,
#     exit 1 if new drift detected. On new drift: prints the new lines to
#     stderr. If SAVE_AFTER_FILE is provided, the current snapshot is also
#     saved to that path as a run artifact.
