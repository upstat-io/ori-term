"""Paired-finding deduplication for verify-roadmap.

Section 03.1 of verify-roadmap-redesign plan (resolved_by_sibling wiring).

Some findings come in semantically-linked pairs: if one half is auto-fixed,
the other half's root cause disappears with it. The paired-dedup pass runs
AFTER `classify_safety()` on the full classified-finding list and marks the
dependent half with `resolved_by_sibling = <independent-half's Finding.id>`
so the auto-fix engine skips it.

Currently handled pairs:

  - plan: → name: rename on PlanIndexSchema
      Independent: UNKNOWN_FIELD(plan) classified SafeFix rename.
      Dependent:   MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD(name) on the same file.
      Semantics:   renaming `plan:` to `name:` also resolves the missing-
                   name finding; applying both halves double-writes.

Design invariants (parallel to safety.py):
  1. pair_resolved_by_sibling is PURE — no I/O, no subprocess calls.
  2. The pass is run by the CLI (`quick.py` / future `full.py`) after
     `classify_safety` has produced ClassifiedFinding records; classifier
     internals never call it (classify_safety is single-finding, pairing
     is cross-finding).
  3. Returns NEW ClassifiedFinding instances (dataclass replace) — never
     mutates inputs; inputs remain frozen.
  4. Only the dependent half gets `resolved_by_sibling` set. The
     independent half carries the SafeFix that actually runs.
