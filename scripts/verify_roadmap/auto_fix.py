"""Auto-fix engine for verify-roadmap.

Section 03.3 of verify-roadmap-redesign plan.

Two-layer architecture:
  1. **Dispatcher** (build_fix_plan): pure ClassifiedFinding -> FixPlan.
     No I/O. Translates SafeFix findings into frontmatter operations.
  2. **Applier** (apply_fixes): orchestrates backup + patcher invocation +
     audit log. Takes a `patcher` callable so tests can stub §03.4's
     apply_patch without circular dependency.

Defense-in-depth invariants (load-bearing):
  - SafetyClass.EXPOSURE_REVIEW findings are REJECTED at apply_fixes entry —
    hard error, not silent skip
  - FM_DECLARED_VS_BODY_DERIVED reaching SafeFix dispatch is REJECTED —
    classifier bug if it reaches us (see §03.1 blind spot #4)
  - parallel: true field is NEVER touched by any fix handler
  - PatchResult(applied=False) DEMOTES the SafeFix to ExposureReview
    in the result (TPR-03-003-codex unapplied-fix surface)
  - All file writes go through the patcher — auto-fix engine does NOT
    write source files directly (only audit + backup files)
