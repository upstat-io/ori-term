## Overview File Template (`00-overview.md`)

The overview is the master document. It answers: **what** is the goal, **why** does it matter, **how** do the pieces fit together, and **in what order** should they be built?

```markdown
---
plan: "{plan-name}"
title: "{Plan Title}: Exhaustive Implementation Plan"
status: not-started
supersedes:             # Plans this replaces (if any)
  - "plans/{old-plan}/"
references:             # Design docs, proposals, prior art
  - "plans/{related-doc}.md"
---

# {Plan Title}: Exhaustive Implementation Plan

## Mission

{1-2 sentences. What is this plan accomplishing and why? Not "implement X" but "complete X as one cohesive system: from A through B to C." Establish scope and intent.}

## Architecture

\`\`\`
{ASCII diagram showing the pipeline/system being built or modified.
Show the flow of data through stages, the key types at each boundary,
and where this plan's sections fit in.}
\`\`\`

## Design Principles

{Name the core architectural principle(s) driving this plan's design.
Explain WHY these matter — cite concrete bugs or pain points that
motivated the principle. 2-3 principles max.}

\`\`\`
{Optional: show the information/data flow chain if applicable.
E.g., how input events flow through the system, or how grid state
reaches the GPU.}
\`\`\`

## Section Dependency Graph

\`\`\`
{ASCII graph showing section dependencies.
Use arrows to show what depends on what.
Note which sections are independent (parallelizable).}
\`\`\`

{Prose explanation:}
- Sections {X-Y} are independent and can be worked in any order.
- Section {Z} requires {X}. Section {W} requires all.

**Cross-section interactions (must be co-implemented):**
- **{Section A} + {Section B}**: {Why these must land together. Cite the
  specific bug or invariant that breaks if only one lands.}

## Implementation Sequence

{Resolve the dependency graph into a concrete build order. Each phase
gates the next; items within a phase can be parallelized.}

\`\`\`
Phase 0 - Prerequisites
  +-- {section}: {task description}

Phase 1 - Foundation
  +-- {section.subsection}: {task}
  +-- {section.subsection}: {task}

Phase 2 - Core implementation
  +-- {section.subsection}: {task}
  Gate: {testable condition proving this phase is complete}

Phase 3 - Integration  [CRITICAL PATH]
  +-- {section.subsection}: {task}
  Gate: {testable condition}

Phase N - Verification
  +-- {section}: {comprehensive testing}
\`\`\`

**Why this order:**
- Phase 0-1 are pure additions — no behavioral changes.
- Phase 2 must precede Phase 3 because {reason}.
- Phase 3 is the critical path because {reason}.

**Known failing tests (expected until plan completion):**

{List tests that are expected to fail and WHY. Prevents wasted effort
investigating "failures" that are symptoms of missing infrastructure.
Include root causes tied to specific phases.}

- **`test_name`** — {symptom}. Root cause: {Phase N} ({missing infrastructure}).

Do NOT attempt to fix these tests individually. They share infrastructure
dependencies that must be built bottom-up through Phases {X-Y}.

## Metrics (Current State)

{Baseline measurements before implementation begins. Establishes the
starting point so progress and regressions can be measured.}

| Module | Production LOC | Test LOC | Total |
|--------|---------------|----------|-------|
| `{module}` | ~{N} | ~{N} | ~{N} |
| **Total** | **~{N}** | **~{N}** | **~{N}** |

## Estimated Effort

| Section | Est. Lines | Complexity | Depends On |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
| {NN} {Title} | ~{N} | Low/Medium/High | — |
|   -> {NN.X} {Subsection} | ~{N} | Low | — |
| **Total new** | **~{N}** | | |
| **Total deleted** | **~{N}** | | |

## Known Bugs (Pre-existing)

{Bugs discovered during investigation that affect multiple sections.
Track root causes, fix locations, and status so they don't get lost.}

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix Location | Status |
|-----|-----------|-------------|--------|
| {Description} | {Root cause analysis} | Section {NN} | Not Started / Fixed / Guarded |

## Quick Reference

| ID | Title | File | Status |
|----|-------|------|--------|
| 01 | {Title} | `section-01-{name}.md` | Not Started |
| 02 | {Title} | `section-02-{name}.md` | Not Started |
```

---

## Index File Template (`index.md`)

The index enables keyword-based discovery across all sections. If this plan is a
**reroute** (a parallel track alongside the main roadmap), add frontmatter to make
it discoverable:

```yaml
---
reroute: true
name: "{Short Name}"
full_name: "{Full Plan Name}"
status: queued
order: N
---
```

- `reroute: true` — marks this plan as a reroute (omit for non-reroute plans)
- `name` — short display name (e.g., "GPU Refactor")
- `full_name` — full display name (e.g., "GPU Renderer Refactor")
- `status` — `active | queued | resolved`
- `order` — queue priority; lower value = promoted first when active reroute completes (default 999 if omitted)
- `key` and `dir` are derived at load time from the directory name

# Section {NN}: {Title}

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** {Expanded goal — what must be true when this section is complete.
Not "implement X" but "X works correctly under conditions A, B, C with
no regressions in Y."}

**Context:** {Why this section exists. What pain point, bug, or
architectural gap motivated it. Cite specific debugging sessions,
test failures, or design flaws. 2-4 sentences.}

**Reference implementations:**
- **{Emulator}** `{file path}`: {pattern name} — {what we learn from it}
- **{Emulator}** `{file path}`: {pattern name} — {what we learn from it}

**Depends on:** Section {NN} ({why}).

---

{Context paragraph: what this subsection does, what problem it solves,
and how it fits into the section's overall goal.}

- [ ] {Task description with enough detail to implement without ambiguity}
  \`\`\`rust
  // Code example showing the target design (types, signatures, key logic).
  // This is the SPEC — the implementation should match this.
  \`\`\`

---

## {NN}.N Completion Checklist

- [ ] {Concrete, verifiable item — not "implement X" but "X passes test Y"}
- [ ] {Item with specific command to verify: `cargo test --test test_name` passes}
- [ ] {Behavioral verification: `test_name` passes without modification}
- [ ] {Regression check: `./test-all.sh` green}
- [ ] {No warnings in `./clippy-all.sh`}

**Exit Criteria:** {Paragraph describing the measurable, testable condition
that proves this section is complete. Include specific commands, test names,
metric thresholds. Not "X works" but "X produces Y output when Z command
is run, with 0 regressions in test suite."}
```

### The `reviewed` Field

- **Section 01**: Always `reviewed: true` — it's the plan's starting point, already vetted during creation.
- **All other sections**: `reviewed: false` — they must be re-reviewed before implementation.

**Why:** As you implement sections sequentially, reality diverges from the original plan. You discover new constraints, make architectural decisions, and deviate from assumptions that later sections depend on. A section written when the plan was first created may reference files that were renamed, assume types that were redesigned, or propose approaches that conflict with decisions made during earlier sections. The `reviewed: false` gate forces `/review-plan` to run on each section right before implementation, when the actual codebase state is known — catching stale assumptions before they waste work.

**`/review-plan` marks only the reviewed section as `reviewed: true`**, not all sections. Each section gets its own review checkpoint.

---

## Verification Section Template

Every plan should include a verification section (typically the last section). This proves the system works as one cohesive whole.

```markdown
## {NN}.1 Test Matrix

Build a comprehensive test matrix covering every feature through the
pipeline being built/modified.

- [ ] **{Feature category}:** ({date started})
  - {Sub-feature} — {status: covered (file.rs) | FIXED (date) | gap: reason (#[ignore])}
  - {Sub-feature} — {status}

### {NN}.1.1 Discovered Gaps

| Gap | Roadmap Location | Test | Severity |
|-----|-----------------|------|----------|
| {Description} | {Section reference} | `test_name` | CRITICAL / Medium / Low |

---

## {NN}.2 Behavioral Equivalence (if applicable)

Verify that the new path produces identical results to the existing path.

- [ ] Build a test harness comparing outputs: {description}
- [ ] Apply to all relevant tests
- [ ] Track and investigate every mismatch
- [ ] Create a CI-runnable script

---

## {NN}.3 Visual Regression (if applicable)

For rendering changes, verify visual output is correct.

- [ ] Capture reference screenshots for key scenarios
- [ ] Compare before/after for grid rendering, selection, search highlights
- [ ] Verify color accuracy (256-color palette, true color, theme switching)
- [ ] Test at multiple DPI/scale factor combinations

---

## {NN}.4 Performance Validation

- [ ] **{Metric 1}:** Measured {what} ({conditions}):
  - {Workload A}: ~{value}
  - {Workload B}: ~{value}

- [ ] **{Metric 2}:** {comparison}:
  - {result with concrete numbers}

- [ ] **Frame time budget:** 60fps target = 16.6ms per frame
  - Typical frame: ~{N}ms
  - Worst case (full redraw + atlas miss): ~{N}ms

---

## {NN}.5 Documentation

- [ ] Update superseded plans to point to this plan
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if new commands/paths/patterns introduced
- [ ] Update relevant .claude/rules/*.md files
- [ ] Add architecture overview to key module docs

---

## {NN}.6 Completion Checklist

- [ ] Test matrix covers all features (every checkbox in {NN}.1)
- [ ] Visual regression verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance baselined
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] `./test-all.sh` green
- [ ] `./clippy-all.sh` green
- [ ] `./build-all.sh` green

**Exit Criteria:** {Final measurable proof. Include test counts, metric
thresholds, and the specific commands that demonstrate completion.}
```

---

## Status Conventions

| YAML Status | Meaning | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `not-started` | No work done | |
| `in-progress` | Partial completion | Include date + current state in header |
| `complete` | All done | Include completion date in header |

Subsection status uses `not-started`, `in-progress`, `done`.

**Progress tracking conventions:**
- `[x]` — completed (include date: `(2026-03-05)`)
- `[ ]` — not started
- `**FIXED** (date)` — a bug discovered and fixed during implementation
- `#[ignore]` — test exists but is skipped due to known gap
- Commit references: `(committed c1c1b534)` for traceability
- Strikethrough `~~text~~` for gaps that were fixed (preserves history)

---

## Writing Principles

### Context Over Brevity
Each section should be self-contained enough that someone can understand
WHY the work exists, not just WHAT to do. Include the bug report, the
debugging session insight, the architectural principle that motivates it.

### Measurable Exit Criteria
"Implement X" is not an exit criterion. "{Command} produces {output}
with 0 failures across {N} tests" is. Every section ends with a
testable, verifiable condition.

### Design Decisions with Trade-offs
When there are multiple approaches, document all of them with pros/cons.
Mark the recommended approach and explain why. This prevents re-litigating
decisions and helps future readers understand the reasoning.

### Cross-References
Link sections that interact. When Section A depends on Section B,
explain the specific failure mode if only one lands. Use
"Co-implementation requirement" callouts for hard dependencies.

### Root Cause Analysis
When a bug or design flaw motivated a section, include the root cause
chain. "X broke because Y, which happened because Z, which is
fundamentally caused by W." This prevents surface-level fixes.

### Reference Implementations
Cite specific files from reference terminal emulators. Not "Alacritty does
this" but "Alacritty's `alacritty_terminal/src/grid/storage.rs` uses the
`Storage` pattern where {description}." Include the path so the
reference can be consulted.

---

## Performance-Sensitive Plans

For plans touching **performance-critical components** (GPU rendering, VTE parsing, grid operations, key encoding), include profiling checkpoints:

### When to Profile

| Component | Profile? | Method |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| GPU renderer (`gpu/`) | Yes | Frame time measurement |
| VTE handler (`term_handler.rs`) | Yes | Throughput benchmark |
| Grid operations (`grid/`) | Yes | Resize/reflow timing |
| Key encoding (`key_encoding.rs`) | Maybe | Manual profiling |
| Config, tab bar, drag | No | Not perf-critical |

### Adding Performance Checkpoints

In sections that modify hot paths, add:

```markdown
## X.N Performance Validation

- [ ] Measure frame time before changes (record baseline)
- [ ] Measure frame time after changes
- [ ] No regressions >5% vs baseline
- [ ] Document any intentional tradeoffs
```

Only add this for sections that:
1. Modify hot code paths (render loop, VTE input, grid cell access)
2. Change data structures (Cell layout, instance buffers, atlas)
3. Add new algorithmic complexity

**Do NOT add benchmarks for**: config loading, tab bar cosmetics, drag state machine, non-hot-path features.
