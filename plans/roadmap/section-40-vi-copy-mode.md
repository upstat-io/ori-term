# Section 40: Vi Mode + Copy Mode

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Keyboard-driven terminal navigation and text selection without touching the mouse. Enter vi mode, navigate with hjkl and word/line motions, visually select text, yank to clipboard, and search within the scrollback. This is a must-have feature for power users — Alacritty, WezTerm, Ghostty, and Kitty all have it.

**Crate:** `oriterm` (modal input dispatch, cursor rendering)
**Dependencies:** Section 09 (Selection model), Section 11 (Search), Section 08 (Keyboard dispatch)
**Prerequisite:** Sections 08, 09, 11 complete.

**Reference:**
- Alacritty `alacritty/src/input/mod.rs` (vi mode dispatch, motions, inline search)
- WezTerm copy mode (`wezterm-gui/src/termwindow/keymap.rs`, CopyMode key table)
- Ghostty vi mode
- Kitty hints mode

**Why this matters:** Keyboard-only text selection is essential for SSH sessions, tiling WM users, and anyone who doesn't want to reach for the mouse. It's the #1 requested feature that separates a "serious" terminal from a toy.

## 40.1 Vi Mode Core

Modal input state machine. Vi mode intercepts all keyboard input and routes it through vi motion/selection logic instead of sending to the PTY.

**File:** `oriterm/src/app/vi_mode.rs`

- [ ] `ViMode` state:
  - [ ] `active: bool` — whether vi mode is engaged
  - [ ] `cursor: ViCursor` — vi cursor position (independent of terminal cursor)
  - [ ] `selection: Option<ViSelection>` — active vi selection (if any)
  - [ ] `search_direction: SearchDirection` — `Forward` or `Backward`
- [ ] `ViCursor` struct:
  - [ ] `row: usize` — absolute row index (scrollback + visible)
  - [ ] `col: usize` — column index
  - [ ] Rendered as a distinct cursor (e.g., filled block in vi mode vs normal cursor style)
- [ ] Enter/exit vi mode:
  - [ ] Toggle: configurable keybinding (default: `Ctrl+Shift+Space` or `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
  - [ ] Enter: vi cursor placed at terminal cursor position, PTY input suspended
  - [ ] Exit: clear vi selection, resume PTY input, scroll to bottom if needed
  - [ ] Also exit on: `Escape` (if no selection), `q`, `i`
- [ ] Input dispatch:
  - [ ] When vi mode active: all key events routed to vi handler (not PTY)
  - [ ] Vi handler interprets keys as motions, selections, or actions
  - [ ] Unknown keys: ignored (not forwarded to PTY)
- [ ] Scrollback access:
  - [ ] Vi cursor can move into scrollback (above visible viewport)
  - [ ] Viewport auto-scrolls to keep vi cursor visible
  - [ ] `display_offset` adjusted as vi cursor moves through history
- [ ] Vi cursor rendering:
  - [ ] Distinct visual: filled block (always visible, no blink)
  - [ ] Color: configurable `vi_mode_cursor_color` (default: bright yellow or theme accent)
  - [ ] Replaces normal terminal cursor while vi mode is active
- [ ] **Tests:**
  - [ ] Enter vi mode places cursor at terminal cursor position
  - [ ] Exit vi mode resumes PTY input
  - [ ] Escape with no selection exits vi mode
  - [ ] Keys not forwarded to PTY while vi mode active

---

## 40.2 Vi Motions

Navigation motions that move the vi cursor without creating a selection.

**File:** `oriterm/src/app/vi_mode.rs` (continued)

**Reference:** Alacritty vi motions (`alacritty/src/input/mod.rs`, vi module)

- [ ] **Character motions:**
  - [ ] `h` — move left one cell
  - [ ] `j` — move down one row
  - [ ] `k` — move up one row
  - [ ] `l` — move right one cell
- [ ] **Word motions:**
  - [ ] `w` — move to start of next word
  - [ ] `b` — move to start of previous word
  - [ ] `e` — move to end of current/next word
  - [ ] `W` — move to start of next WORD (whitespace-delimited)
  - [ ] `B` — move to start of previous WORD
  - [ ] `E` — move to end of current/next WORD
  - [ ] Word boundary detection reuses Section 09.4 `char_class()` function
- [ ] **Line motions:**
  - [ ] `0` — move to column 0 (beginning of line)
  - [ ] `^` — move to first non-blank character
  - [ ] `$` — move to last non-blank character
  - [ ] `g0` — move to first column (same as `0` in terminal context)
  - [ ] `g$` — move to last column
- [ ] **Vertical motions:**
  - [ ] `H` — move to top of viewport
  - [ ] `M` — move to middle of viewport
  - [ ] `L` — move to bottom of viewport
  - [ ] `gg` — move to top of scrollback (first row)
  - [ ] `G` — move to bottom of buffer (last row)
  - [ ] `Ctrl+U` — half page up
  - [ ] `Ctrl+D` — half page down
  - [ ] `Ctrl+B` / `PageUp` — full page up
  - [ ] `Ctrl+F` / `PageDown` — full page down
- [ ] **Bracket matching:**
  - [ ] `%` — jump to matching bracket (`()`, `[]`, `{}`, `<>`)
  - [ ] Scan forward/backward for matching pair with nesting
- [ ] **Inline search:**
  - [ ] `f<char>` — move to next occurrence of `<char>` on current line
  - [ ] `F<char>` — move to previous occurrence of `<char>` on current line
  - [ ] `t<char>` — move to just before next occurrence
  - [ ] `T<char>` — move to just after previous occurrence
  - [ ] `;` — repeat last inline search (same direction)
  - [ ] `,` — repeat last inline search (opposite direction)
- [ ] **Semantic motions:**
  - [ ] `*` — search forward for word under vi cursor
  - [ ] `#` — search backward for word under vi cursor
- [ ] Auto-scroll: viewport follows vi cursor when it moves outside visible area
- [ ] Center view: `zz` — center viewport on vi cursor row
- [ ] **Tests:**
  - [ ] `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` move cursor by one cell in each direction
  - [ ] `w` jumps to next word start
  - [ ] `b` jumps to previous word start
  - [ ] `0` moves to column 0, `$` to last non-blank
  - [ ] `gg` moves to top of scrollback, `G` to bottom
  - [ ] `%` finds matching bracket
  - [ ] `f<char>` finds character on current line
  - [ ] Cursor clamps to grid boundaries (no out-of-bounds)

## 40.3 Vi Selection

Visual selection modes within vi mode. Selections created in vi mode use the same Selection model from Section 09.

**File:** `oriterm/src/app/vi_mode.rs` (continued)

- [ ] **Selection modes:**
  - [ ] `v` — toggle character-wise visual selection
  - [ ] `V` — toggle line-wise visual selection
  - [ ] `Ctrl+V` — toggle block (rectangular) visual selection
- [ ] Selection mechanics:
  - [ ] First press: set anchor at vi cursor position, enter visual mode
  - [ ] Subsequent motions: extend selection from anchor to vi cursor
  - [ ] Second press of same key: cancel selection (return to normal vi mode)
  - [ ] Different visual key: switch selection mode (e.g., `v` then `V` switches to line-wise)
- [ ] Selection rendering:
  - [ ] Reuse Section 09.7 selection rendering (same visual highlight)
  - [ ] Selection updates on every vi cursor movement
  - [ ] Selection bridge: convert `ViSelection` to `Selection` for rendering
- [ ] **Yank (copy):**
  - [ ] `y` — yank (copy) current selection to clipboard, exit vi mode
  - [ ] `Y` — yank entire line(s) to clipboard, exit vi mode
  - [ ] After yank: clear selection, optionally exit vi mode (configurable)
- [ ] **Open action:**
  - [ ] `o` — open URL/hyperlink under vi cursor (same as Ctrl+click)
  - [ ] Checks OSC 8 hyperlink first, then implicit URL detection
- [ ] **Escape behavior:**
  - [ ] If selection active: `Escape` clears selection (stays in vi mode)
  - [ ] If no selection: `Escape` exits vi mode entirely
- [ ] **Tests:**
  - [ ] `v` starts character selection at cursor
  - [ ] Motion after `v` extends selection
  - [ ] `V` starts line selection
  - [ ] `Ctrl+V` starts block selection
  - [ ] `y` copies selection text and exits vi mode
  - [ ] `Escape` clears selection first, then exits vi mode

## 40.4 Vi Search Integration

Search from within vi mode using `/` and `?` motions.

**File:** `oriterm/src/app/vi_mode.rs` (continued)

**Reference:** Alacritty vi search (`alacritty/src/input/mod.rs`, SearchAction)

- [ ] **Enter search from vi mode:**
  - [ ] `/` — open search bar, search forward from vi cursor
  - [ ] `?` — open search bar, search backward from vi cursor
  - [ ] Reuses Section 11 search infrastructure (search bar, regex, highlighting)
- [ ] **Search result navigation:**
  - [ ] `n` — jump to next search match (same direction)
  - [ ] `N` — jump to previous search match (opposite direction)
  - [ ] Vi cursor moves to the match position
  - [ ] If selection is active: selection extends to include match
- [ ] **Search match as motion:**
  - [ ] Search match start/end positions are valid motion targets
  - [ ] `v/pattern<Enter>` — select from cursor to first match of pattern
- [ ] **Search confirmation/cancellation:**
  - [ ] `Enter` — confirm search, close search bar, vi cursor at match
  - [ ] `Escape` — cancel search, vi cursor returns to pre-search position
- [ ] **Search history:**
  - [ ] `Up`/`Down` in search bar: navigate previous searches
  - [ ] Search history shared with Section 11 search
- [ ] **Tests:**
  - [ ] `/` opens search bar in forward mode
  - [ ] `?` opens search bar in backward mode
  - [ ] `n`/`N` navigate between matches
  - [ ] `Escape` in search restores vi cursor position
  - [ ] Search with active selection extends selection to match

## 40.5 Section Completion

- [ ] All 40.1–40.4 items complete
- [ ] Vi mode toggles with configured keybinding
- [ ] All character, word, line, vertical, and bracket motions work
- [ ] Inline search (`f`/`F`/`t`/`T`) finds characters on current line
- [ ] Visual selection modes: character (`v`), line (`V`), block (`Ctrl+V`)
- [ ] Yank copies selection to clipboard
- [ ] `/` and `?` search integrates with Section 11 search
- [ ] `n`/`N` navigate search matches
- [ ] `*`/`#` search for word under cursor
- [ ] Vi cursor rendered with distinct style
- [ ] Auto-scroll follows vi cursor through scrollback
- [ ] `cargo clippy --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` — no warnings
- [ ] `cargo test` — all vi mode tests pass

**Exit Criteria:** Power users can navigate the entire scrollback, select arbitrary text, and yank to clipboard without touching the mouse. Vi mode feels natural to vim users — all standard motions work as expected.
