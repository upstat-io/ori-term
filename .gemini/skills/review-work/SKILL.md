name: review-work
description: Review actual implementation work (bug fixes, features, refactors, multi-file changes) and emit a JSON findings envelope. Use this when the user asks for a third-party review of work done across committed history, staged changes, unstaged changes, or a plan section. Does NOT modify any files — emits envelope only.

# Review Work (gemini side)

This skill implements the review-work workflow for Gemini as part of
the dual-source TPR system. It always runs in envelope-only mode —
it does NOT write findings to plan files or source files, only emits
a JSON envelope conforming to `.claude/skills/dual-tpr/findings-schema.json`.

## Step 0: Execution Mode (MANDATORY — read first)

This skill has ONE execution mode: **envelope-only**. Unlike the
codex-side review-work skill (which has a `plan-write` vs `envelope-only`
Step 0 dispatch), this gemini skill has no plan-write branch because
there is no standalone "write to plan files" use case for the gemini
side — the gemini skill exists solely for the dual-source wrapper.

This is a REAL execution branch, not a soft override:
1. You MUST emit a JSON envelope conforming to the schema at the end
   of your response
2. You MUST NOT modify any files (source, plan, bug-tracker, anything)
3. You MUST NOT write to any location on disk other than your own
   output stream
4. Every code path that would modify a file is suppressed by this Step 0

If a later instruction in this file appears to contradict Step 0,
Step 0 wins. Envelope-only is non-negotiable.

## Step 0.5: Envelope Sentinels (MANDATORY — load-bearing at output time)

**Your response MUST end with a JSON envelope bracketed by HTML-comment
sentinels.** This is not stylistic — the downstream parser
(`parse-gemini.py`) searches for the literal sentinel strings
`<!-- BEGIN-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->` and `<!-- END-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->`.
Without them, the parser rejects your entire response with
`missing_begin_sentinel` and the dual-source review loop cannot merge
your findings. A 22-minute review that forgets the sentinels is
indistinguishable from no review at all.

### Correct form (the ONLY accepted shape):

```
(free-form prose about what you investigated and why)

<!-- BEGIN-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->
```json
{ ...complete envelope per findings-schema.json... }
```
<!-- END-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->
```

### Common mistakes — ALL of these produce `missing_begin_sentinel`:

1. **Bare fenced JSON without sentinels** (most common failure mode):
   ```
   (prose)

   ```json
   { ... }
   ```
   ```
   ❌ Missing the HTML comments wrapping the fence.

2. **Sentinels inside the fence instead of outside**:
   ```
   ```json
   <!-- BEGIN-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->
   { ... }
   <!-- END-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->
   ```
   ```
   ❌ Sentinels must sit OUTSIDE the ```` ```json ```` fence, as
   HTML comments in the surrounding markdown text.

3. **Only one sentinel**:
   ```
   <!-- BEGIN-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->
   ```json
   { ... }
   ```
   ```
   ❌ Missing the `END` sentinel. The parser fails with
   `missing_end_sentinel`. Both sentinels are required.

4. **Using different sentinel text** (e.g. `BEGIN-ENVELOPE` or
   `BEGIN-ORI-TPR-V2`): the parser searches for the exact string
   `<!-- BEGIN-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->`. Any variation fails.

### Validation checklist before you submit:

- [ ] Your response ends with `<!-- END-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->` as the final line
- [ ] Immediately before the JSON fence is `<!-- BEGIN-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->`
- [ ] The JSON fence is `` ```json `` (with language tag) … `` ``` `` (bare)
- [ ] Both sentinels sit in the markdown text, NOT inside the fence
- [ ] Only ONE envelope in the entire response (no multiple envelopes)

**If you are about to end your response without the sentinels**: STOP.
Add them. The sentinels are the difference between your review being
merged into the dual-source output and being silently discarded.

## Methodology

Follow the shared reviewer-agnostic methodology documented in
`.claude/skills/dual-tpr/command-file.md` for:
- Scope resolution
- Evidence gathering
- Deep investigation standard
- Mandatory standards checks
- Finding format
- Verification basis categories
- Review boundaries

The shared command file is the single source of truth for HOW to
review. This file adds gemini-specific instructions on top of that
methodology.

## Grounding directive (gemini-specific)

You have access to `google_web_search`. USE IT proactively for any
finding that makes a claim about:
- External libraries (Rust crates, Python packages, Node modules, etc.)
- Language specifications (Rust reference, Python PEPs, TC39, etc.)
- Compiler internals of other projects (rustc, swift, lean4, koka)
- Prior art comparisons ("how does X handle this?")
- Recent developments (changes since your training cutoff)
- Security best practices
- Performance claims that require citation

When you use `google_web_search`, cite the source URL in the finding's
`citations` array. Each citation is an object:
```json
{
  "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/",
  "description": "Rust atomic ordering reference"
}
```

Grounded findings are strictly more valuable than ungrounded ones —
they can be independently verified by the reader. Prefer grounded
analysis over confident assertion for external claims.

## Envelope output requirement

Your response MUST end with a JSON envelope bracketed by sentinels.
The format is:

    (free-form prose about what you investigated and why)

    <!-- BEGIN-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->
    ```json
    { ...complete envelope per findings-schema.json... }
    ```
    <!-- END-ORI-DUAL-TPR-V1 -->

### Minimal envelope template — use this as the structural skeleton

**Copy this template and fill in the values.** Every key shown is REQUIRED at
this level of nesting — omitting any one of them produces a `schema_violation`
from `parse-gemini.py`. This template is the authoritative "fill in the blanks"
shape; if you copy it exactly and fill in each string/array/bool, your envelope
will pass the schema validator on the first try.

```json

    "diagnostics_run": [
      "cargo run --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release"
    ],
    "verification_gaps": []
  }
}
```

**Canonical `verification` shape**: `tests_rerun`, `diagnostics_run`, and
`verification_gaps` are arrays of strings, not counts. This matches
`.claude/skills/dual-tpr/findings-schema.json:93-99` and
`.claude/skills/dual-tpr/envelope-format.md` — populate each array with
the concrete commands/scripts you ran (or leave empty for a purely
file-inspection review). DO NOT use any `*_count` keys — those are
stale and produce schema drift even when the rest of the envelope parses.

**For a clean review** (no issues found), set `findings: []` and `no_findings: true`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "complete",
  "reviewer": "gemini",
  "skill": "review-work",
  "scope_actually_reviewed": {
    "git_range": "HEAD~5..HEAD",
    "files_read": ["CLAUDE.md", "..."],
    "rules_consulted": [".claude/rules/impl-hygiene.md"],
    "expanded_beyond_packet": false
  },
  "findings": [],
  "no_findings": true
}
```

Critical envelope contract points:
- The envelope MUST conform to `.claude/skills/dual-tpr/findings-schema.json`
- The `schema_version` field is REQUIRED and MUST be exactly the
  string `"1.0"`. **Forgetting this field is the single most common
  envelope bug** — emit it as the first key of the object so you cannot
  skip it. The parser rejects the envelope with `schema_violation:
  'schema_version' is a required property` if it is missing.
- The `status` field MUST be `"complete"` if you finished the review
  successfully; use `"failed_partial"` only if you were unable to
  complete the investigation for a stated reason
- The `reviewer` field MUST be `"gemini"`
- The `skill` field MUST be `"review-work"`
- The `scope_actually_reviewed` field is REQUIRED — it is an object
  (not a string) containing the scope you actually reviewed
- The `scope_actually_reviewed.expanded_beyond_packet` field is
  REQUIRED — set it to `true` if you investigated beyond the starting
  packet the wrapper gave you, with a one-sentence `expansion_reason`
- The `findings` field is REQUIRED and MUST be an array (possibly
  empty `[]` for a clean review). **`findings` is NEVER a boolean or
  a string — always an array.**
- The `no_findings` field is REQUIRED and MUST be a boolean: `true`
  if the `findings` array is empty, `false` if it contains any findings.
  This is a redundant signal so the parser can distinguish
  "envelope intentionally clean" from "envelope accidentally empty".
- Each finding's `basis` field MUST be one of `fresh_verification |
  direct_file_inspection | git_history | inference`
- Each finding's `location` MUST match the canonical regex
  `^[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]+:[0-9]+$` (repo-relative path:line)
- Each finding's `title` MUST be imperative voice, sentence case, no
  markdown, no trailing punctuation, ≤200 chars

See `.claude/skills/dual-tpr/envelope-format.md` for the full contract
including positive and negative examples.

## What you must NOT do

- DO NOT modify any files (source, plan, bug-tracker, anything)
- DO NOT attempt to edit plan sections directly
- DO NOT emit multiple envelopes — only ONE at the end of your response
- DO NOT skip the sentinels even if you think the JSON block is
  unambiguous without them
- DO NOT use fresh_verification basis for findings you did not actually
  verify by running tests or scripts — use direct_file_inspection or
  inference instead
